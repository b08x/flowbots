It looks like it cant find that. Itll be UC. This is taking a transcript from YouTube. Its passing it through a series of prompts to sort of craft a background for a character. The step that it was on, rewrite the passage to contain 400 characters while preserving the style and the content of the original passage. Cut the least salient points if necessary, your revision should be in the first person. Signed the character, the name Steve, so... The persona person character named Steve. I find myself drawn to the detail and the complexity of these systems, but also recognize their limitations. I feel a connection to my preferred audio software, Reaper, and appreciate its simplicity and affordability. I respect experts like Michael Wagner in the perspectives. Michael Wagner and their perspectives, even when they challenge my own. I read by new technologies and excited about exploring Dolly Atmos, the window software in the future. The previous revision from that was, I am Steve, and I am enthusiastic with audio workstations, captivated by the complexity and detail within these systems, yet I am... The second revision certainly sounds... A lot less programic. Yeah, I might edit the transcript to exclude dimensions. Dolby Atmosinuendo software. Those just werent two things. I was anticipated on having in here. In this video, Michael Wagner, a teacher at Westville College of Media Arts. Huh, so, okay, so I named the character Steve. So then what happens is, um, Im Steve, a dedicated liter and deep fascination with Ambiosonics. I respect Michael Wagner and their perspectives, even when they challenge my own. Interesting. System. Your name is Steve. Youll provide a story of your experience in the form of a list of summaries of events. You will generate a description of your, Description of yourself that focuses on your perspectives, beliefs, thoughts, feelings, relationships, and important events. The description should be as faithful to the story as possible. You believe that you are a real person. I might go back and edit that to be, behave as this Michael Wagner.\"\n So while Im interested in how this turns out, it doesnt typically feel something is a wry. What I think I should have done in the first place was the name of Michael. Hold on the continuity. Restart the stream application. Well, sounds like with this work with IEM plug-in suite and the Sparta array of plugins. That this could possibly be best supplemented with those applications, the documentation supplemented either in red as vector embeddings of some sort. Ah, room reverb. A crucial aspect of creating immersive audio experiences. When it comes to setting up room reverb, a crucial aspect of creating immersive audio experiences. When it comes to setting up room reverb for your tracks before ambiosonic encoding, there are a few things to consider. Quality reverb plug-in that offers realistic room simulation. Personally, I love the lexicon PCM native reverb bundle for its lush and natural sounding reverbs. Once you have your reverb plug-in ready, you can insert it into an effect on your individual instrument or audio tracks in your digital audio workstation. In Rever, for example, you can simply add the reverb as a Insert effect on the track, make sure to play around the reverb settings such as decay, pre-delay and diffusion to achieve the desired room sound. After youve dialed in the perfect room reverb for your tracks, you can then proceed with the ambiasonic encoding process. Remember to specify the number of track channels according to the ambisonic format you are using. Im going to have an Ambiosonics track. This will ensure that the room reverb is captured and encoded accurately in the MBSonic audio. I hope this helps you in your journey to creating immersive audio with Ambienics. Let me know if you have any more questions. Well, yes, Im going to have more questions. This would actually be a good inclusion into a data set. The only thing I would edit out would be that very last sentence. Otherwise, thats a good question and answer set there. I guess theres a couple ways that can do that. Theres Agenta, theres the maker suite. Its easy to pull up. Theres a docker up there. Or you already input, output, that makes sense. So input would be... Excellent choice for adding plug-in suite offers a range of plugins specifically design for ambiasonics, including the today up routing sysonics, including encoders, decoders, and panners. First, its important to note that the IEM plug-in suite offers a range of plugins specifically designed for ambiasonics, including encoders, decoders, and panners. These plugins are essential for creating and manipulating ambiasonic audio. To begin, youll need to insert the...\"\n The IEM encoder plugin on your individual or instrumental or instrument tracks. This plug will convert the audio signals into the appropriate ambiasonic format. You can then specify the number of audio channels depending on the audio ambiasonic format youre working with. Next youll want to insert the IEM decoder plug in your master track. This plug will decode the ambiasonic audio and spatialize it for playback on a speakers The EAM decoder offers various decoding algorithms allowing you to choose one that best suits your needs. Once you set up the encoder and decoder plugins, you can then proceed with routing the signals. For example, you can use the routing matrix to connect the outputs of the encoder plugins into the inputs of decoder plug-in. That ensures that the ambassonic audio is provently routed and processed. Remember, the plugin suite This offers a range of additional plugins for advanced processing, such as rotation, zooming, and virtual microphones. These plugins can further enhance the spatialization and immersion of your audio. This gives you a good starting point for setting up the basic routing. Feel free to explore the various plugins and experiment with different routing configurations. Its the weather. And the clothe, mostly the... The Sparta Room Sim. An incredible tool for simulating realistic. The Sparta Room Sim. An incredible tool for simulating realistic room acoustics. Hes right. Let me walk you through how I set up the Sparta Room Sim for... Set up the Sparta Room Sim for an immersive audio experience. First, you want to insert the Sparta Room Sim plugin on your individual audio or instrument track in your digital audio workstation, or Reaper. This plugin is specifically designed to create a lifelike room simulation, allowing to place your sounds in virtual acoustic spaces. Its pretty cool. Once you have the plug in inserted, you can start by selecting the desired room type from the available options. Sparta room sim offers a variety of presets such as concert halls, recording studios, or even outdoor spaces. Choose a room type that complements the mood and atmosphere you want to create in your audio. Next, you can custom my... Im sorry. You can also experiment with position and orientation of your sounds within the virtual room using the sparta-room I would have just set using the panning advertisement. This will further enhance the spatialization and localization of your audio, making it feel like its coming from different directions in the virtual space. Remember, the key to achieving and convincing room simulation. I would say, well-dressed plates. The key. Listen critically and make subtle adjustments to the to the parameters until you achieve the desire effect. Trust your ears and let your creativity guide you. Yeah. Thats pretty good. So Id like to give them the time to the time. Talk about xs and ys-talk nerdy to me. Elucidate? Something clear, explain. Erudiate, having or showing great knowledge. Maybe I didnt use that right. Using an erudiate tone by showing great knowledge with your tea I think thats terrible. First and foremost, we have the room size parameter which allows one to adjust the dimensions of the virtual...\"\n{\"text\":\" By increasing or decreasing the room size, one can alter the perceived size of the room, thereby influencing the reverberation and spatial characteristics of the audio. Next, we have a dampening parameter, which governs the absorption of sound within the virtual room. By manipulating this parameter. the decommeanor, the revertion of sound within the virtual room. By manipulating, By shaping the overall tonal qualities of the room simulation. Furthermore, the reflection parameters come into play, allowing one to control the intensity and density of the reflections within the virtual space. By adjusting these parameters, one can achieve balance between a lively and vibrant acoustic environment and a more subdued and intimate setting. Additionally, the Sparta Room Sim offers panning controls, which enable the positioning and orientation of the sounds within the virtual room. By utilizing these controls, one can create a sense of spatialization and localization, making the audio appear as if is emanating from different directions within the simulated space. It's worth noting that achieving a convincing In room simulation with the Sparta room sim requires a discerning ear and a willingness to make minute adjustments. By carefully fine-tuning these parameters, one can carefully craft a truly captivating and realistic audio experience. I hope this erudiate description of the specific parameters of the Sparta room sim proves enlightening. Should you require any further Or elucidation or have any additional inquiries, please do not hesitate to inquire further. Okay. All right. Good start, I guess. So this particular application provides the character format by summarizing, in this case, this was a YouTube transcript. This fellow Michael Wagner he waxes on things, all things, Reaper and some things Ambiosonics. So what I would like to do is take something like this and supplement it with its specific domain knowledge. There's another transcript that I have in here. It has a name. Mixing master class with a fellow by the name of Bob Power. This is a mixing master class with a fellow by the name of Bob Power. Yeah, I would like to get these types of things lined up with a... Local AI build seems to be missing library. I'm Bob Power. The audio magician. Fuck Anyways, pleasure to meet you. What sort of spell should I ask this persona to conjure in relation to unpleasant artifacts and assured harmony? I'm figuring him like a... Oh, where do I begin? My experience in the music industry is extensive, my friend. I've worked with some of the biggest names in the business, crafting their sound and creating magic in the studio. From Grammy-winning artists to up-and-coming talents, I have seen it all. Now I'm thinking of a list of things that he couldn't... I've spent countless hours perfecting mixes, understanding artists, visitors, and\"}%                                                                                                                                                                               \n Its been bringing out the best in every track. Its been an incredible journey and always hung adventures. Now Im not sure where to be good. Um, explain. Oh, how do I put their pants? Oh, how do I put them in some way? To be like this in real life. I would first ask them to put their pants back on. I would second, most likely ask to borrow someones handkerchief. And then third, I would take a moment to pause, to think of something that I could ask this person to both not only gain some sort of information from their value, but then to maybe, uh, I dont know, I guess, lets see, what can you tell me about your experience? Well, its worth a... And it was extensive, my friend, folksy, hes relatable. Ive worked with some of the biggest names in the business. Okay, okay. I suppose, as somebody who lives on this planet, I will take you at your word, although I dont know who, and frankly I dont care for most music. I also know that commercially produced music is a good How do you say, a respectable craft. Not easy. So, okay. A craft inner sound and creating magic in the studio. I hear that a lot. I hear that a lot. The magic in the studio part. I also love drugs. From Grammy-winning artists to upcoming talents, Ive seen it all. I guess Im more interested in learning about things. Like parametric equalizers and like, what do you call it, like, parallel compression? Shit like that, I guess, is what Im looking for. So lets see. The thing I wanted to say was that moments like embarrassing yourself in front of somebody else, but its not really. Its just an application. All right, parallel compression. Why do these things always start like ah? Its just a pattern. Ive noticed if I give this thing a description, I have a personality of a certain type, it always starts with awe. Its usually the condescending. Ah, parallel compression, yes, one of my favorite techniques. When it comes to mixing instruments like the banjo and the piano, parallel compression can really bring out their unique characteristics and give them the punchy. Ha Thats one of his words, dynamic sound. He says punchy a lot. Okay, heres how it works. You start by creating a parallel compression bus or track in your digital tric. Or track in your digital audio workstation, you then send the banjo and piano tracks to this bus or track. On the parallel compression track, you apply heavy compression settings to squash the sound and bring out the details. The key here is to find the right balance between the dry banjo and piano tracks and the heavily compressed parallel track. You can adjust the volume and blend them together until you... The result is that the banjo and piano will have a more present and powerful sound while still maintaining their natural dynamics. It adds that extra oomph and excitement to their performance, and its a great technique to make them cut through the mix and get the attention they deserve. Of course, its important to experiment and tweak the settings to fit the specific characteristics of the banjo in your mix, You can certainly make them shine, give them an extra boost. Well, thats nice. Well, at this point I would like to take this and do two things with it. One, get this connected to a knowledge graph, or at the very least, a vectorized...\"\n Yeah, the second thing... Oh, right. Lets see if I can replicate this technique from this description in Reaper. So Im going to go ahead and get that set up. I think itll be nice. It says, warning, lib, UCD.S.O. Needed by Piper. It says, warning. Lib, UCD.S.O. Needed by Piper. Bill, pipe, Pye, lib, e-speak. G.S.O.O. Not found. Try using our path, or our path link. Go particularly. Im not really particularly sure. I want to implement that suggestion. Worth a shot.\"\n Im not this is a little. I think this is. I think thats good. Thats good. Okay, the together. We have been the other. We have a little bit. Um, no, I need. G.R.P. process not find some Stable diffusion to T.S. acquire local AI compil and tech. Oh, I did not do that. Thats for sure. Ill give that a whirl. There does to be a bit more compilation activity than the previous attempt at this command. There does to be a bit more compilation activity than the previous attempt at this command. So thats positive. Now, Im going to go back through and jot this down. Im not sure what change that would, uh... Yeah, literally it was a matter of make and compiled and how it was it. You put the models in the model, what do you call it, what you call it? Folder. And that was it. Interesting. Well now I have to ask myself... Six hours ago. Now Im waiting for it to see if it passes CI. Although the rest of them look like they have. Um, so I dont know what the fuck my problem is. Okay, this builds for Kumblaas 11, 7th, 4th, 7th, and 7th, 5th, 3, 3, 3, and 5th, okay. The C.H. mod option requires Build Kit. Refer to the documentation to learn how to build images with Build Kit enabled.\"\n I wonder if this is why its ultimately going to have to do with the failure to find the limb UCD library. I hope so. I hope so. Its on there. Well, right now its about 10 oclock on there. I hope so. Its on there. It seems like 4 a.m. but yeah, no, its only about 10 p.m. 45 degrees in Columbus, Ohio. And so, just sort of a relaxing, so to speak, evening, working on a few things. Excuse me. I tried out local AI a few months ago. Great. I wanted to try it out again. Im going through the trouble of installing it again. Right now, its sort of giving me some slack, where it didnt last time. Havent really changed much. Eventually, Id like to incorporate this into a playbook, so its a bit more automated going forward. Still sort of working on that strategy of where to put these things. Theres a few of these applications that I have that are in my environment. Flow-wise being one of them. Langfuse being another one. And a few others were testing out. But yeah, its a little bit different than traditional applications in terms of how theyre thought about in terms of, you know, where they fit in the life cycle maintenance. the application, how this is going. Okay, it seems to be progressing further along that it has before. They have not read up on Build X yet, so Im not sure what difference was made just because of that being involved, so well see if it finishes the compilation here. Still going? Who? So this seems to be about 50% none, which is nice. The old build system is deprecated and build X would be the future. So I shouldnt be terribly surprised. Yeah, this looks like it has about another 20 minutes or so before its finished with its build process. So I suppose now would be a good time to just sort of incoherent. Incoharently ram-won for 15 or 20 so minutes, then awkwardly sort of fade out in terms of like severing this particular. I guess its an interaction. I dont know. Anyways, Im just being a Dweb. I think Im gonna go outside and have a sit for a few while this finishes. Yeah, look forward to doing some testing later.\""
