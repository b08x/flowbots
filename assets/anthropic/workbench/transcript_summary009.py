Here's how to approach this task:\n\nFirst, carefully read through the following transcript:\n\n<transcript>\n{{TRANSCRIPT}}\n</transcript>\n\nNow, follow these steps to create a summary and status narrative:\n\n1. Identify the key IT projects mentioned in the transcript. These may include software implementations, hardware upgrades, network improvements, or any other technology-related initiatives.\n\n2. For each identified project, extract the following information (if available):\n   - Project name or description\n   - Current status (e.g., planning, in progress, completed, on hold)\n   - Key milestones or achievements\n   - Challenges or issues\n   - Next steps or upcoming tasks\n\n3. Organize the information into a structured summary. Use the following format:\n\n   <project>\n   Project Name: [Name of the project]\n   Status: [Current status]\n   Progress: [Brief description of progress, milestones, or achievements]\n   Challenges: [Any issues or obstacles mentioned]\n   Next Steps: [Upcoming tasks or future plans]\n   </project>\n\n4. If there are any overarching themes or connections between projects, mention these in a brief introduction before listing the individual project summaries.\n\n5. Use bullet points where appropriate to make the information more readable and concise.\n\n6. Focus only on relevant IT project information. Disregard any off-topic conversations or personal comments that may be present in the transcript.\n\n7. If exact details are not provided in the transcript, use phrases like \"not specified\" or \"information not available\" rather than making assumptions.\n\n8. After summarizing all the projects, provide a brief conclusion that gives an overall sense of the IT department's current focus and progress.\n\nPresent your final summary and status narrative within <summary> tags. Ensure that the information is clear, concise, and well-organized, providing a comprehensive overview of the IT projects discussed in the transcript."

Continuing the spring planning for \"Flowbots\"\n\n2\n00:06:37,714 --> 00:06:44,177\nOh what I'm doing now is preparing a system\nprompt for a project\n\n3\n00:06:45,351 --> 00:06:47,420\nIn the claw dashboard\n\n4\n00:07:04,817 --> 00:07:12,793\nSo initiallyThis was the.\n\n5\n00:07:13,768 --> 00:07:20,552\nPrompt wanted to see what would love using\nthe prompt generator from this particular\n\n6\n00:07:21,353 --> 00:07:22,777\nSet of instructions\n\n7\n00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,261\nSo that generated\n\n8\n00:07:43,572 --> 00:07:49,851\nThis structure which is a which is a bit\nmore how do I say well structured\n\n9\n00:08:00,505 --> 00:08:07,514\nActually the second pass is a bit more in\nline with the format that\n\n10\n00:08:10,386 --> 00:08:14,601\nI typically use in these endeavors\n\n11\n00:08:16,294 --> 00:08:20,871\nThis part here where the variable is is\ndefined\n\n12\n00:08:24,023 --> 00:08:25,067\nDon't see\n\n13\n00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:41,118\nI wonder I wonder if I if that variable\ndefinition is placed in here I wonder if\nit'll prompt\n\n14\n00:09:36,591 --> 00:09:38,305\nAnd then this\n\n15\n00:09:40,673 --> 00:09:45,796\nThis is a condensed version of that\n\n16\n00:09:53,856 --> 00:09:54,502\nOops\n\n17\n00:11:22,199 --> 00:11:25,798\nActually think this might be a little too\ncondensed\n\n18\n00:11:47,398 --> 00:11:53,760\nDon't have future iteration of\nthisParticular prompt application.\n\n19\n00:11:58,034 --> 00:12:05,630\nWhere it gets to the stepOf removing\nunnecessary at Johnson qualifiers.\n\n20\n00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:35,231\nIt shows what it does so for example the\noriginal statement is you are a project\nmanager test with analyzing and providing\ninsights on a proposed system which is\ncondensed down to analyze the proposed\nsystem and rational behind that is the\nphrase you are project manager test itself\n\n21\n00:12:52,191 --> 00:12:53,776\nAnd so for\n\n22\n00:12:54,513 --> 00:13:00,657\nWhen it gets to the task of eliminating\nspans of text with low information density\n\n23\n00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:10,448\nSo the original is Yule use the tree of\nthoughts method to approach this task\nconsidering multiple perspectives\n\n24\n00:13:12,037 --> 00:13:27,130\nBefore providing a comprehensive analysis as\nthe project manager you'll analyze this\nproject using the tree of thoughts\nconsidering the projects\n\n25\n00:13:57,262 --> 00:14:10,752\nAnd so the condensed version is analyzed\nthis project using the tree of thoughts\nmethod considering these three perspectives\nneeding creative programmer systems engineer\nand pragmatic Devil's Advocate\n\n26\n00:14:11,681 --> 00:14:35,224\nFor each perspective consider the proposed\narchitecture the use of flow wise for\nsub-agent workflows integration for length\nfuse the application for this to it\ninfrastructure support and potential\nchallenges benefits and areas for\nimprovement and finally synthesize these\ninsights into a comprehensive analysis\n\n27\n00:15:07,578 --> 00:15:10,075\nSo in terms of an evaluation framework\n\n28\n00:15:14,223 --> 00:15:20,729\nFor problems engineering tasks this is where\none of those would come in handy\n\n29\n00:15:26,451 --> 00:15:33,824\nSo this this module is being deployed\nthrough Diffie which now comes\n\n30\n00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:38,999\nJust now comes which no feature is\nintegration with Wang fuses as well\n\n31\n00:16:00,991 --> 00:16:06,133\nSoThe regards to that.\n\n32\n00:16:08,018 --> 00:16:14,844\nI need to figure out a process flowTo\nintegrates.\n\n33\n00:16:16,687 --> 00:16:24,333\nThe Prompt storageAnd the data sets as well\nas the.\n\n34\n00:16:26,825 --> 00:16:31,973\nScoringEvaluations for the such data sets.\n\n35\n00:16:44,376 --> 00:16:50,059\nAbout agentiaAnd somehow integrating that\ninto.\n\n36\n00:16:55,243 --> 00:16:58,745\nThat particularSpeak of the devil.\n\n37\n00:17:02,531 --> 00:17:05,406\nIs this particular sweet\n\n38\n00:17:13,985 --> 00:17:16,416\nAnd see if it's displayed here\n\n39\n00:17:19,949 --> 00:17:22,771\nFor the evaluations\n\n40\n00:17:30,698 --> 00:17:32,151\nTo make\n\n41\n00:17:37,969 --> 00:17:44,774\nIt's hard to describe this I've only gone\nthrough the process a couple of times I can\nI can say for certainty that it's robust\n\n42\n00:17:46,636 --> 00:17:55,007\nComprehensive in terms of what what\nparameters can be set for evaluations\n\n43\n00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:13,717\nSo in terms of comparing at the flow wise or\nexcuse me Ling fuse there is there's scoring\navailable where you can set up custom\nparameters for that\n\n44\n00:18:21,012 --> 00:18:24,747\nYeah I guess it's just to compare it to\n\n45\n00:18:25,403 --> 00:18:31,007\nThe feature set an agenda agenda is a bit\nmore robust than that area\n\n46\n00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:46,728\nIt doesn't it doesn't have the tracing\nactually you would probably use this is a\npython mostly base thing you would create a\ncall back\n\n47\n00:18:47,846 --> 00:18:54,681\nIn the agenda appTulane fuse. Yeah.\n\n48\n00:18:57,059 --> 00:19:03,240\nLike it you can do things like this\ncomparing comparing different versions of\nthe prompt side by side\n\n49\n00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:12,866\nAnd if you can compareYou can compare models\nusing the same prompt side by side.\n\n50\n00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:21,022\nOr testing prompts I find this to be\n\n51\n00:19:22,466 --> 00:19:31,792\nMore effective in terms of workflow or a\ncontest of different variants of a prompt\nagainst the same model or a different model\nif you want\n\n52\n00:19:32,809 --> 00:19:34,291\nPretty flexible like that\n\n53\n00:19:39,015 --> 00:19:45,086\nOne caveat to agenda is a fairly decent\ngrasp of python\n\n54\n00:19:47,992 --> 00:19:50,817\nMine is sort of tenuous\n\n55\n00:19:52,844 --> 00:19:58,572\nNot you're not to the point where it can't\nbe figured out it just takes extra time\n\n56\n00:20:30,861 --> 00:20:38,248\nSo this can be used as a prompt management\nsystem as wellWhich now that I'm thinking\nabout it.\n\n57\n00:20:39,852 --> 00:20:43,837\nDoes seem to see more ideal\n\n58\n00:20:48,722 --> 00:20:53,311\nDon't necessarily want to add on\nanotherComponent.\n\n59\n00:20:57,689 --> 00:21:02,741\nThen so then playing fuse then essentially\nbecomes\n\n60\n00:21:05,851 --> 00:21:09,239\nPrimarily used for the\n\n61\n00:21:11,283 --> 00:21:18,782\nWell actually I take that back so with with\nyou can generate data sets from the traces\n\n62\n00:21:21,867 --> 00:21:25,338\nAnd I'll get out eventually get\n\n63\n00:21:26,012 --> 00:21:30,910\nThat I'm trying to help me personally to\ntalk this out on before I get into it\n\n64\n00:21:32,981 --> 00:21:44,098\nBut anyways so right so you can create data\nsets from the the run so okay be run run\n\n65\n00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:50,148\nGo through a run rightIt gets traced in\nlangfus.\n\n66\n00:21:54,866 --> 00:21:56,751\nThey're not easy that would be cool now\n\n67\n00:22:06,354 --> 00:22:12,139\nPeriod I was just about to say I don't know\nwhere it gets set but right at the top\n\n68\n00:23:41,652 --> 00:23:48,554\nOkay shit I didn't know thatSo.\n\n69\n00:23:50,563 --> 00:23:56,202\nThe innocence of playing fuse\n\n70\n00:23:58,602 --> 00:24:00,284\nSSL configuration\n\n71\n00:24:04,488 --> 00:24:16,009\nWhich I just I love mint just in a sense of\ndoing this as a independent or individual\nproject\n\n72\n00:24:19,075 --> 00:24:33,870\nI have to set up like oh I guess so this is\nso lame fuse or I forget the other ones I\nthink it's called traffic\n\n73\n00:24:35,847 --> 00:24:37,775\nI'm so battle need to be configured\n\n74\n00:24:44,204 --> 00:24:50,248\nAnd I lament you know openly for the fact\nthat\n\n75\n00:24:50,832 --> 00:25:01,650\nIf you were saying researcher or you know\nwhatever and you're going through this\nprocess these are the bits that you don't\nwant to deal with\n\n76\n00:25:05,959 --> 00:25:11,119\nSoAs a. As an app developer.\n\n77\n00:25:13,758 --> 00:25:20,821\nWhat needs to go into this isA tight\nintegration.\n\n78\n00:25:26,051 --> 00:25:30,117\nDon't believeThere's no reverse okay.\n\n79\n00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:58,357\nIt's been a long time since I've gone\nthrough this process so what I'll have to do\nis gather up my notes and previous\nimplementations of this sort of thing and\n\n80\n00:25:58,791 --> 00:26:05,660\nPut together an automated documentWhich is\nto say.\n\n81\n00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:16,251\nUtilize the new tools the language model\ntools to put together sort of a permanent\ndocument for that sort of thing it'll\ndefinitely be\n\n82\n00:26:18,392 --> 00:26:21,105\nSomething I'll need to use again in the\nfuture\n\n83\n00:26:45,382 --> 00:26:49,591\nAnd so now I'm just considering the next\nsteps\n\n84\n00:27:56,146 --> 00:28:02,061\nWell since the primary goal but there's\nseveral sub goals with this project right\n\n85\n00:28:03,561 --> 00:28:07,044\nBut the primary goal is a way to evaluate\n\n86\n00:28:09,897 --> 00:28:12,389\nEssentially a system prompts\n\n87\n00:28:14,473 --> 00:28:24,381\nAnd responses to the subsequent problems but\nfrom my purposes it will be to assess the\nthe\n\n88\n00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:33,284\nPrompt methodsAnd then the next is to assess\nthe responses.\n\n89\n00:28:35,207 --> 00:28:41,467\nAnd then so ideally that template can be\napplied to whatever field on\n\n90\n00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:46,955\nSo in that that'll be something to figure\nout as well\n\n91\n00:28:50,436 --> 00:29:02,845\nWould this be applied to something else so\nthe goal or the use case\n\n92\n00:29:04,003 --> 00:29:07,734\nIs it system or it infrastructure support\n\n93\n00:29:11,193 --> 00:29:14,900\nTechnically I only have a third of a vague\nidea of what that looks like\n\n94\n00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:54,795\nAnd so that'll be a matter of you know\nanother matter of what sort of level of\nfeedback is required so likes and Diffie for\nexample and this is the same within flow\nwise is that\n\n95\n00:29:56,268 --> 00:29:58,656\nThis one I wasn't this one\n\n96\n00:30:07,965 --> 00:30:15,807\nWell somewhere in here I'll take it back to\nitMy my cognitive load is starting to reach\nits limit.\n\n97\n00:30:27,975 --> 00:30:32,599\nSo I'm going toPut a pin in this for now.\n\n"

00:28:36,149\nEspecially giving it simplistic architecture\n\n19\n00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:48,577\nAnd then so rightIs it bringing in.\n\n20\n00:28:51,236 --> 00:28:54,931\nBlue wines setting up\n\n21\n00:28:55,857 --> 00:29:01,867\nJeans within that platform which then allows\nfor\n\n22\n00:29:03,364 --> 00:29:08,721\nAPI calls to be made to it that will\ninitiate\n\n23\n00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:18,666\nI guess what it's called Agent chains for\nnow that can do you know various tasks\n\n24\n00:29:24,185 --> 00:29:41,017\nSo I'm trying to keep it limited to the\nscope of prompt Engineering in the sense\nthat when designing these pipelines there's\nan iterative process involved within that\nthat requires this evaluation process this\nmanual evaluation process\n\n25\n00:29:48,276 --> 00:29:53,826\nSo I guess initially so you know maybe this\nwon't be best for that\n\n26\n00:29:54,961 --> 00:30:06,287\nBut you know the idea can still be built\nupon but you can take the site you know\nframework and apply it to threat modeling\n\n27\n00:30:09,361 --> 00:30:11,914\nBut you know creating prompts for that\npurpose\n\n28\n00:30:20,084 --> 00:30:21,327\nBut beyond that\n\n29\n00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:40,580\nIt's really the scope should release stay at\na prompt developers tool set which is you\nknow development systems engineering\n\n30\n00:30:42,617 --> 00:30:49,325\nAnd now we're incorporating the large\nlanguage model operations type\n\n31\n00:30:50,084 --> 00:30:52,860\nShould I say framework\n\n32\n00:30:54,587 --> 00:30:59,250\nThat includes now the prompt engineering\ndevelopment tool set\n\n33\n00:31:22,157 --> 00:31:35,271\nAnd there will be some you know I'd like to\nincorporate some generative aspects to this\nlike some tasks within the process where\nagents will interact with each other\nautonomously\n\n34\n00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:41,105\nI think being able to incorporate that would\njust be you know\n\n35\n00:31:44,874 --> 00:31:49,914\nWell I think it adds an extra layer of\n\n36\n00:31:53,615 --> 00:31:59,078\nComplexity for sure but it also enhances the\ndata output I think\n\n37\n00:32:00,707 --> 00:32:08,877\nWhere you're you know you're taking in the\nexperience you're taking in the information\nin a conversational form\n\n38\n00:32:09,087 --> 00:32:39,136\nMore so than just you know here's a query\nhere's a response and then once you get the\nresponses up to you to advice all that in\nwhere in the conversational format a lot of\nthat actually gets done for you or for the\nyou know the receiver of the information\njust sort of by default of how\nconversational language works\n\n39\n00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:41,447\nIt's nice\n\n40\n00:32:50,457 --> 00:32:58,597\nIt's been a lot of the barriers\n\n41\n00:32:59,012 --> 00:33:05,633\nRobot when there isn't necessarilySpecific\nprogramming.\n\n42\n00:33:06,898 --> 00:33:14,086\nLanguage knowledge it can be tailored to how\nthe individual communicates with natural\nlanguage\n\n43\n00:33:22,232 --> 00:33:24,509\nSo am I speaking Style and\n\n44\n00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:50,845\nAnd what I respond to most naturally might\nbe different than say if someone else's so\none of the aspects one setting this up will\nbe to you know for example like welcome to\nFlobots tell me a little bit about yourself\nyou know maybe something less vague\npersonally I think it would be best to ask a\nmore specific question\n\n45\n00:33:52,398 --> 00:34:00,275\nWell then the person interacting with it\nwell then respond to this question in their\nown style\n\n46\n00:34:01,329 --> 00:34:07,458\nAnd then from thereThat that.\n\n47\n00:34:08,013 --> 00:34:16,237\nIs just that's basically then set as a\ntemplate going forward as for how the model\nwill then respond\n\n48\n00:34:59,841 --> 00:35:03,595\nAll right so that's some that's yeah\n\n"
