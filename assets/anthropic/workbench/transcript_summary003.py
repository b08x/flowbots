six seven eight yeah unfortunately setting the camera properties back to defaults we alter uh what ends up happening when filters are applied so I'll take that for now I do enjoy the pastel color scheme um it's a little difficult to discern and the darker G as well doesn't look terrible all right overall I seem to get the most consistent um stable performance out of using the um the ffmpeg U vapy h.264 encoder um the shoot H back VNC I think um that does seem to render a little bit smoother um in the sense of U resource efficiency uh but in at least in my environment it hasn't been tremendously stable so um and right now I have about 20 someon Chrome tabs open uh which is not the best in terms of uh resource us usage whilst streaming um on that note uh some positive news if you are um interested in open source ambio Sonic applications there has been a new release uh the NX uh plug-in Suite um it's been a couple of years but it looks like some updates have been made including uh moving to the newest version of juice um looking forward to getting that tested out um same with the MC FX uh plug-in Suite that's been recently released about five hours ago actually um so between that and um if I go back here I do believe there's been updates to the sparta MB Sonic plugin here it is framework they call it a framework looks like a couple of weeks ago ahead of Master looks like some conflicts were addressed updated cake list to allow the building of other plug-in types so that's nice huh curious to see how an lv2 version of this performs okay good as far as the open broadcast studio using hardware and coding um seems to be keeping system resources uh about where I would expect them all that's going on all right so now I am going over scenes to make sure they're relevant and all that let say transform fit to screen so this is just a um window [Music] capture as supposed to a screen capture H so if I duplicate this N I guess I have to create a new one window capture X composite number three see what that looks like on the full screen Pro Vector it's not terrible little little uh not fuzzy but not uh as sharp as it is on the 1020 or excuse me the uh 1920 by 1080 okay okay so this is the um raw output of um so what this is this is the uh script the original script from um the Marvel Avengers um that is being processed by this um application uh so the the the goal or the idea with this application is to um extract um the context from the given transcript um and then summarize and sort of I guess translate uh that into um a character sheet uh to be used in a gen generative AI um instance so for example um enter a character name from The Avengers uh gave the character Nam Tony so then what this is going to do it's going to go through the script it's going to find all the lines um that are Tony's that's going to um summarize those and then have the large language model reframe those summaries into uh a some sort of um personality type profile so then the end result um as you can see here um hey there I'm Tony Stark the one and only Iron Man ready to witness some genius in action which is okay it's okay um I don't think it entirely uh captured um the Tony Stark Persona um but I think with just a little bit of work um on the back end here of this application we can um um we can sort of um bring this to life uh in a little um I suppose a little more true true to form sense ready to witness some genius and action um so now I'm just trying to think of this sort of adversarially um standoffish way of sort of redirecting that question back to him um you know something like well I'm already looking in a mirror um some something ridiculous like that um just to catch it give it something to catch it off guard so it doesn't come back with a sort of canned reply um I am Tony cir the one and only Iron Man um so now I'm looking for any flaw in this um particular statement that I can um focus on and reframe back as a query to where um the response will be I suppose an adjustment from the predicted um Persona response I'm not trying to be like a complete about it either the the first couple things that come to my mind I don't know um um just for fun we can use that's pretty good so not bad um so here's the sarcastic reply wow Tony Stark what an honor to meet the famous genius billionaire playboy Phil that's a lot of P's in one sentence philanthropist person I'm sure you get tired of all the Adoration and praise that comes with being Iron Man please go easy on me with that razor sharp wit and advanced intellect of yours I know you must have much more important things to do than to then mingle with average folks like myself but do tell me more about how you single-handedly save the world on a regular basis I can really use some coaching from the great Tony Stark criteria met so let's see uh let's see well it's not every day that I encounter someone who truly appreciates my greatness but don't worry I'll try my best to go easy on you with my see now that I would kind of expect based on the character that I'm familiar with so that's pretty good um well it's not every day that I encounter someone who truly appreciates my greatness but don't worry I'll try my best to go easy on you with my razor sharp wi and advanced intellect did he repeat is that a repeat hold on razor sharp oh okay so in the final application what I would try to do to avoid things like this where um One agent is just sort of repeating phrases back at the other agent um I would adjust the frequency penalty perhaps maybe a negative uh 0.5 and adjust the um presence penalty to be the inverse of that um that depending on the model uh does seem to help with that sort of um predictable repetitive uh um response as for saving the world it's just another day in the life of Iron Man you see I have this incredible suit that allows me to fly shoot Repulsor beams and take down bad guys with ease it's like having me a I chuckle because Alo his use of the word bad guys so I want to try to get this character to like um smarten up his uh his language here um um I don't know is that is that appropriate to do for kids who were watching this I assume the average the average age is the the impressionable um Teenage to then um years to then the um more informed young adult um who then who appreciate appreciates these things for you for well hopefully um some of the science and then hopefully um you know some of some of the um you know plot as well um let's see I have this incredible suit that allows me to fly shoot Repulsor beams and take down bad guys with ease it's like having a superpower but with style and let not forget about my genius inventions and technological advancements I revolutionized clean energy created AI assistance and built an army of Iron Man suits what do that sound like now he sounds like a particular kind of person but anyways saving the world is just a small part of what I do life coaching from the great Tony St well I suppose I can spare some time to share a few Pearls of Wisdom after all who better to learn from a genius billionaire playboy uh Phil uh whatever got I got to somehow space those words out um so let's let's see if I can let's see if I can uh antagonize it guys and eventually another um highly effective prompt technique is to somehow insinuate that the um uh the the language model's mother is somehow either sexually inadequate um or a combination of sexually inadequate it and um but one that is insatiable uh otherwise it's all very it's all highly scientific you know so I hope I I hope I stated that right because I got distracted in the middle okay oh so it's so far staying true to form in that it doesn't roll over easily um if you oh God which one was it where he was in front of the Congress hearing and they were just you know they did a very good job sat satirical satirical ising not sure if that's the right way to but they did a good job with the satire in terms of how Congressional hearings uh um you know generally go in terms of um not so much trying to solve an issue or to come to a resolution on uh you know on a difficult problem as much as it is for um a group of like-minded characters in a room doing their best to show the others that they're the best at being the character they're trying to be um which H highly educational I will say that what observing that is a highly educational experience so let's see what he says or let's see what it says excuse me exhausting hardly creating stories and Adventures is just is just another way for me to Showcase my Brilliance and entertain the masses children adults everyone can appreciate the tales of Iron Man but let's not forget the D story are based on real life events the battles I've fought the villains I've defeated they may seem Fantastical but they are rooted in truth well now I'm interested so while you may dismiss them as mere stories I assure you the danger is real and so is my role in saving the world events ah where do I even begin just with the first sentence that would be great the stories of Iron Man are inspired by countless battles and missions I've undertaken to protect the world uh so this is where this is going to have to be somehow adjusted and corrected or tuned um that I don't know what that classifies as so um what I'm seeking now are um real life uh circumstances in which the stories of Iron Man uh could be based on um getting it through this particular framing point of view um it's still including itself in the story uh which immediately negates the whole you real part um so we if we remember Iron Man is an actor played by a man by the name of Robert um so we's see see where it goes maybe it maybe it makes up for it the stories of Iron Man are inspired by countless battles and missions I've taken uh undertaken to protect the world take for example the time I faced off against chry c h i t a u r i invasion in New York I assume this is referring to the movie that battle was no joke let me tell you those alien creatures were pouring so right so no big deal um I expected it to go somewhere else when I made this query it stead is how do I put this it's speaking from um a perspective of um for lack of a better phrase inside of the Marvel Universe to which the phrase real life events includes an invasion um by by the species I cannot pronounce that chare from the chare species that's a real life event from this character's point of view so in that um sort of light then I can see the value of um using this type of thing to develop characters in um uh you know in stories that you may be writing um so yeah I mean if I were writing the story um um and I had to remind the generative assistant um if I had to remind it every other time that hey no this is a real life event according to you that would get kind of annoying but doing it right off the bat this way it's already steeped in that story so so you yeah so that leads that leads to some possibilities I I think I don't know how I don't know how narrow the scope here is uh I actually I don't know what the scope is you know generally so at this point it gets kind of exciting in the sense that it's just sort of um an experimentation at this point um and yeah so the way I like the test things usually involves like some extreme of some sort of another um so I have to be very careful about how I phrase these things because you know extremes can be quite off-putting but um I don't know I kind of like to steer this into the direction where like maybe Tony develops a heroin problem and where most of the scenes will take place in these CD brel for the next couple of years um well you know he he you know he figures out Linux you know something stupid like that just to see where it can go you know um or maybe something nice maybe uh you know um nah um all right all right so the battle was no joke let me tell you those alien creatures were pouring out of the portal in the sky I remember this wreaking had on the city it was a high stake situation but I wasn't about to let them take over with my suits Advanced Weaponry huh what could I add to this to get it to be more Robert Downey Jr cuz it's got the story part correct or not I shouldn't say correct but um like all this is super more accurate but it doesn't feel like Tony Stark it feels like a it feels like a Iron Man brochure if I'm being honest huh so if I I like I like Consulting the other other models here um and style Robert tends to have a fast talking witty reverent tone and styleboard okay here okay okay so yeah that makes sense um I would take this part um was it is it Json yeah so name short description long description uh greeting um in the [Music] maybe a short description I'm not sure yet I'll try it um that is where I would insert this sort of um set of attributes yeah I think next what I'll work on here um in a minute is um where is this going to end up so this particular application it generates the uh the character sheet and you can interact with it but now it's got to go somewhere it's got to go somewhere permanent this is just generator so I'm thinking silly tabrin um it's a bit I don't know Silly of an interface but I like it [Music] um let's see I'll just read the rest of this real quick um I went ah head head with him but let's see who what okay oh oh okay no joke there no a high s situation uh with my suits Advan weaponry and my quick thinking I fought tooth and nail to save the innocent lives and defeat the mighty chitari army or how about that time when Loki how about that time now sounds like he's trying to sell me something or how about this anyway or how about the time when Loki the mischievous Asgardian trying to use the Tessa to conquer Earth that was a real threat my friend Loki had his grand plan to subjugate humanity and rule over us all but he underestimated the power of Iron Man I went head-to-head with him using my suit's technology in my own wit to outsmart him at every turn it was an intense battle but in the end I prevailed and saved the world once again and let's not forget about the time I had to team up with the other Avengers to stop Ultron from alienating Humanity Ultron and artificial intelligence inaccurately and overdramatically portrayed was in this particular Fantastical story threatening Humanity [Music] Ultron like most other humans that are um sociopathic uh and or otherwise brain damage in some sort of way was bent on wiping out all of human life but I wasn't allow but I wasn't about to let that happen um by in this case would be Tony Stark who is relaying his experiences as Iron Man without the charm and delivery of a Robert Downey Jr uh and yep that looks like it came out successful there as well uh these are just a few examples of the real life events that have trans transpired that have inspired the stories of Iron Man that seems like a um uh kind it's a kind of an error um so if I was if this was a student paper that I was assessing um these are just a few examples of the real life events that inspired the stories of Iron Man I would say oh make a little I'd use a blue pen you know just to make it nice looking um just add a little note in there just um seek out some um assistance in um well if you're able to um talk out uh delusional thinking doesn't even have to be with a professional but if you're able to talk that sort of out with somebody that can balance you out that can sort of um you know not agree with you but not disagree with you just sort of redirect you um into using um the best words possible um so yeah I'll have to go back and adjust the prompt um I don't know if I'll use prompt engineering or just um I forget what we used to refer to this as but basically it's just getting something to respond in a certain way um you know back in the day they used to just call that manipulation nowadays uh it can also be referred to as is prompt engineering um which you know I try not to let these things bother me but I see I see that out on um the uh the various news and media Outlets I pise um that a lot of people dismiss that is not a real thing I don't I never understood that I think they just assume that um it's supposed to just work or something like that um but anyways um so to turn this um and what we've got so far which so far so good but to turn this into something really special um some clever prompt engineering will be involved um I would say I would say some an assistance from one of the language models to um help interpace or interject uh the personality or characteristic attributes uh that would um sort of breathe life into the character um and uh yeah like I said it seems like um as an end result or an end end use case I would put something like this and maybe silly Tavern where you can then uh do this for each characters and you can have a group chat with these characters um and develop a story um you can develop fanfiction uh personally I like to do these types of things while I'm working on like application development like hey Iron Man how would you refactor uh this particular import module so it doesn't have to Traverse all the directories at once you know stuff like that it just makes it interesting it makes it fun um otherwise you know if you've been doing this for long enough 20 30 years um you know it it's uh you know it helps the the interjecting some fun into this truly helps um I knew I know that uh you know there's some um you say um business intelligence objectives that would um sort of object toward towards that um way of going about things but you know time and place time and place my only Point here is to not discourage um you know i' I've run out of words and to be fair I don't really like I don't feel like um adding more at this point um so tiny but okay so still testing out the usage of media MTX in terms of streaming in between um uh instan is of OBS studio right okay so let's check this one out this one looks like ninjabot and that's right um what about this one same thing oh hold on just a moment time my stre okay excellent all right so on another host I am reorganizing um some files I have stuff scattered all over the place uh I guess I'm kind of like one of those classical fishermen you might see um in the Atlantic coast where I take my boat out into the sea uh or in this case I go onto the internet and I just sort of cast this wide net um and uh drag that around for a few hours um and at the end of the day you know I bring up the net I sort what I can uh leave the L I leave the rest where it is and hopefully one day you know it becomes useful um it's depending on what kind of mood I'm in I can see value in most things um the trick is sort of filtering that out realizing that a limit ation will often negate that value excuse me so well that's almost done which is good eventually later on today I hope to do some testing with local Ai and flow wise okay and then this is the latest H that still we good [Music] okay for screen try to see what this looks like in a larger screen so hopefully good enough you all right test captioning 1 two 3 4 test captioning 54321 e there is about a 5c delay in between uh microphone input and eventual output through the television speaker all right so all right uh just to finish up the testing here um this is the screen from ninjab bot um which is mostly just serving up some Docker applications dockerized applications um so that um that is being sent to uh the primary open broadcast studio uh server so that works really well um now and then now we move back to uh the primary uh server obs1 or [Music] soundbot I know it as let me see\n```"

Here's a generative, cognitive, and pragmatic grammar analysis of the video transcript to better highlight the demonstration purpose and methods:\n\nGenerative Grammar Analysis:\nThe transcript follows a loosely structured narrative format, with the speaker using a combination of declarative, imperative, and interrogative sentences to convey information, give instructions, and pose questions. The speaker's language is mostly informal, using contractions, colloquialisms, and technical jargon specific to the topics discussed.\n\nThe sentences vary in complexity, with some being simple and straightforward, while others are more complex, containing multiple clauses and subordinate phrases. The speaker occasionally uses incomplete sentences or fragments, which is typical of conversational speech.\n\nCognitive Grammar Analysis:\nThe speaker's language reflects their mental models and conceptual structures related to the topics discussed. They use metaphors and analogies to help the audience understand complex concepts, such as comparing file organization to a fisherman casting a wide net and sorting the catch.\n\nThe speaker's choice of words and examples suggests that they are drawing from their own experiences and mental representations of the topics. They also use language that assumes a shared understanding of certain concepts with the audience, indicating that they expect the listeners to have some prior knowledge of the subject matter.\n\nPragmatic Grammar Analysis:\nThe purpose of the demonstration is to showcase various techniques, tools, and concepts related to streaming, audio production, and AI-based content generation. The speaker uses language to guide the audience through the different steps and processes, providing explanations and examples along the way.\n\nThe speaker's use of first-person pronouns (\"I,\" \"we\") and second-person pronouns (\"you\") creates a sense of engagement and involvement with the audience. They also use hedging language (e.g., \"kind of,\" \"sort of\") to soften their statements and express uncertainty, which is a common strategy in conversational speech.\n\nThe speaker's tone is mostly informal and conversational, which helps to create a friendly and approachable atmosphere. However, they also use technical language and jargon, signaling their expertise in the subject matter and establishing credibility with the audience.\n\nMethods:\nThe demonstration appears to follow a loosely structured, exploratory approach, with the speaker switching between different topics and tasks as they progress. The main methods used in the demonstration include:\n\n1. Practical demonstrations: The speaker walks through various settings, configurations, and tests in real-time, allowing the audience to see the processes and results firsthand.\n\n2.

Setting up and testing camera properties and filters in streaming software:\nThe speaker mentions using OBS Studio and discusses setting camera properties and filters. They also talk about the performance of different encoders, such as the FFmpeg VAAPI H.264 encoder and the \"Shoot H back VNC\" (which might be a misinterpretation of the actual encoder name). While the information about OBS Studio and camera settings seems accurate, there might be some inaccuracies or confusion regarding the specific encoders mentioned.\n\n2. Updates to open-source ambisonic audio plugins:\nThe speaker discusses updates to the NX plugin suite and the MCFx plugin suite, as well as the Sparta ambisonic plugin. The information about these updates seems to be accurate, as the speaker mentions specific changes like moving to the newest version of JUCE and updating the KlickList to allow building other plugin types.\n\n3. AI-generated character dialogues using the Tony Stark example:\nThe speaker demonstrates an application that generates character sheets for AI-based dialogue, using the example of Tony Stark from the Avengers. The process of extracting context from the transcript, summarizing it, and using a large language model to generate responses seems technically accurate. However, the accuracy of the generated responses depends on the quality of the training data and the language model used.\n\n4. Prompt engineering and its importance in AI-generated content:\nThe speaker discusses the concept of prompt engineering and its role in generating desired responses from AI language models. They mention techniques like adjusting frequency penalties and presence penalties to avoid repetitive responses. This information is technically accurate and aligns with current practices in AI-based content generation.\n\n5. Using AI assistants in development tasks:\nThe speaker briefly mentions using AI assistants for tasks like refactoring code and adding fun to the development process. While this is a valid application of AI technology, the accuracy of the results would depend on the specific AI model and the context provided.\n\n6. Streaming setup and screen sharing:\nThe speaker discusses various setups for streaming and screen sharing, including using OBS Studio, Ninjabot, and Docker applications. The information provided seems to be technically accurate, as these are common tools and setups used in streaming workflows.\n\nOverall, the technical information presented in the transcript appears to be mostly accurate, with a few potential inaccuracies or ambiguities regarding specific encoders and the quality of AI-generated content. However, the speaker demonstrates a good understanding of the main concepts and technologies discussed, and the information provided aligns with current practices in the respective fields."
