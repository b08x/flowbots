The designated scenario, a marker to the present circumstance within the action space. The language is generated, responding to facial cues, which then triggers an entire sequence of related events that progress an interaction...\n\nSo, what I'm looking for, are combinations of words or phrases that exactly match the structure, cadence and pattern of the verse. Functional and generative grammars should also match. Additional parameters; [Portmanteaus, clauses and subclauses, avoid simple subject-verb-object,a rhythm based on the internal logic of the words]\n"

The portmanteaus (e.g. dreamstate, playspace, heartspace), clauses and lack of simple SVO structure add complexity.
