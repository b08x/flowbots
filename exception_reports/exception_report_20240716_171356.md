# ðŸ¤– FlowBot Exception Report ðŸ¤–


## Summary
The error 'no implicit conversion of nil into String' indicates that the program attempted to perform string operations on a nil value, which is not allowed in Ruby. This error occurred during the execution of the Flowbots CLI command-line interface.

## Technical Details

### Backtrace:
The error occurred in the `TopicModelProcessor.rb` file at line 61, specifically in the `exist?` method. This method is called from the `load_model` method in the same file, as indicated by the backtrace. The error then propagated through the initialization of the `TextProcessor` and `TopicModelProcessor` classes, eventually reaching the `process_text` method in the `cli.rb` file, which is where the error was raised.

### Relevant Files:

#### TopicModelProcessor.rb:
This file contains the `TopicModelProcessor` class, which extends the `TextProcessor` class. It appears that the error is occurring in the `load_or_create_model` method, where the program attempts to load an existing model or create a new one. The relevant code snippet is:

```ruby
def load_or_create_model
  if File.exist?(@model_path)
    logger.info "Loading existing model from #{@model_path}"
    @model = Tomoto::LDA.load(@model_path)
  else
    logger.info "Creating new model"
    @model = Tomoto::LDA.new(**@model_params)
  end
  logger.debug "Model loaded or created"
end
```
Here, if `@model_path` is `nil`, the `File.exist?` method will raise the error, as it attempts to call `exist?` on a nil value, which is not allowed.

#### TextProcessor.rb:
This file defines the `TextProcessor` class, which is the superclass of `TopicModelProcessor`. It provides methods for processing files, including classifying the file type and parsing the file based on its type.

#### cli.rb:
This file contains the `CLI` class, which is a Thor-based command-line interface for interacting with the Flowbots system. The `process_text` method in this file is where the `TopicModelProcessor` is instantiated and the `run` method is called, triggering the execution of the text processing workflow.
