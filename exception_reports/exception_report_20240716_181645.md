# ðŸ¤– FlowBot Exception Report ðŸ¤–


## Summary
The error "uninitialized constant TextProcessingWorkflow" occurred in the Flowbots::CLI class. This indicates that the TextProcessingWorkflow class was not properly defined or imported.

## Technical Details
The error occurred in the following code snippet from workflows.rb:
```ruby
workflow = Object.const_get(workflow_class).new(workflow_file)
```
The backtrace indicates that the error occurred during the execution of the `run` method in the `Workflows` class of `workflows.rb`.

## Possible Causes and Solutions:
- **Incorrect Class Definition**: Ensure that the `TextProcessingWorkflow` class is defined correctly and that the class name matches the constant name.
- **Autoloading Issues**: The issue may be related to autoloading, where Rails tries to guess the location of the class based on a set of autoloading paths. Try referencing the class with the full name, e.g., `::TextProcessingWorkflow`.
- **File Not Found**: Verify that the file containing the `TextProcessingWorkflow` class exists and is located in the expected path.
