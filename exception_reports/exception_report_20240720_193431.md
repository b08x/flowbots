# ðŸ¤– FlowBot Exception Report ðŸ¤–


## Summary
An error was encountered when attempting to execute the `say @pastel.green("Workflow completed successfully")` command. The error message "undefined method `green' for nil:NilClass" indicates that the program tried to call the `green` method on an object that was `nil`.

## Technical Details
The error occurred in the `workflows` method of the `Flowbots::CLI` class, specifically on the line `say @pastel.green("Workflow completed successfully")`.

The `@pastel` object is `nil`, which means it has not been initialized or assigned a value. This resulted in the `green` method call failing, as `nil` does not have a `green` method.

To resolve this issue, ensure that the `@pastel` object is properly initialized or assigned a value before attempting to call the `green` method on it.

## Relevant Code Snippet
```ruby
module Flowbots
  class CLI < Thor
    # ...

    desc "workflows", "List and select a workflow to run"
    def workflows
      workflows = Workflows.new

      selected_workflow = workflows.list_and_select

      if selected_workflow
        begin
          workflows.run(selected_workflow)
          say @pastel.green("Workflow completed successfully")
        rescue FileNotFoundError => e
          say @pastel.red(e.message)
        rescue StandardError => e
          ExceptionHandler.handle_exception(self.class.name, e)
        end
      end
    end
    # ...
  end
end
```
