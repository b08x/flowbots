# ðŸ¤– FlowBot Exception Report ðŸ¤–


## Error Report: Uninitialized Constant TopicModelProcessor

**Summary:** 

The application encountered a fatal error during text processing due to an uninitialized constant `TopicModelProcessor`. This suggests that the `TopicModelProcessor` class was called before it was loaded or defined, leading to execution failure.

**Technical Details:**

* **Class:** Flowbots::CLI
* **Error Message:** uninitialized constant TopicModelingTask::TopicModelProcessor
* **Affected Code:** `topic_processor = TopicModelProcessor.instance` in `topic_modeling_task.rb:8`
* **Root Cause:** The `TopicModelProcessor` class is being called by `TopicModelingTask` before it has been initialized or loaded into the application. 
* **Backtrace:** The error originates from the `execute` method within `TopicModelingTask` and propagates through the text processing workflow triggered by the CLI.

**Relevant Files:**

* `topic_modeling_task.rb`
* `text_processing_workflow.rb`
* `cli.rb` 
* `command.rb`
* `thor_ext.rb`

**Next Steps:**

1. **Verify Class Definition and Loading:** Ensure `TopicModelProcessor` is defined correctly and loaded appropriately within the application.
2. **Check Dependencies:** Investigate any dependencies the `TopicModelProcessor` class may have and ensure they are met before its invocation. 
3. **Review Execution Order:** Examine the code execution flow to confirm `TopicModelProcessor` is initialized *before* the `TopicModelingTask` attempts to use it.

**Recommendation:**

Prioritize resolving the missing `TopicModelProcessor` initialization to restore the text processing functionality.
