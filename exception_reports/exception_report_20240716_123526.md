# ðŸ¤– FlowBot Exception Report ðŸ¤–


## Error Report: Undefined Method `topic_distribution`

**Summary:**

The application encountered an error during topic modeling. The `topic_distribution` method is undefined for the `Tomoto::LDA` object. This suggests an incompatibility between the `Tomoto` gem version and the expected method call within the `TopicModelProcessor` class.

**Technical Details:**

* **Class:** `Flowbots::CLI`
* **Message:** undefined method `topic_distribution` for #<Tomoto::LDA:0x00007602bb094a50>
* **Method Call:** `@model.topic_distribution(k).to_json`
* **Location:** `TopicModelProcessor.rb:222` within the `store_all_topics` method.
* **Backtrace:** The error originated from the `store_all_topics` method, called during model training in the `process` method of the `TopicModelProcessor`. This was triggered during the execution of the `topic_modeling_task` within the `text_processing_workflow`.

**Possible Causes:**

1. **Outdated `Tomoto` Gem:**  The installed `Tomoto` gem version may not include the `topic_distribution` method.
2. **Method Name Change:** The method name in the `Tomoto` gem might have been changed or deprecated in a newer version.

**Recommended Actions:**

1. **Verify `Tomoto` Gem Version:** Check the installed `Tomoto` gem version and compare it to the documentation to confirm the existence of the `topic_distribution` method.
2. **Consult `Tomoto` Documentation:** Refer to the official `Tomoto` gem documentation for any updates, changes, or deprecations related to retrieving topic distributions. 
3. **Inspect `Tomoto::LDA` Object:** Debug the application and inspect the available methods for the `Tomoto::LDA` object at the point of error to identify the correct method for retrieving topic distributions.
4. **Update or Revert Gem:** If an outdated version is identified, update the `Tomoto` gem to the latest version. Alternatively, revert to a previous version known to have the required functionality. 

By addressing these potential causes, the team can resolve the error and ensure the proper functioning of the topic modeling process.
