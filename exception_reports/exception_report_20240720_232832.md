# ðŸ¤– FlowBot Exception Report ðŸ¤–


## Summary
An error has occurred due to an attempt to call a method on an object that has not been defined. 

## Technical Details
The specific error message, "undefined method `green' for nil:NilClass", indicates that the code attempted to call the `green` method on an object that was `nil` (null). 

This issue can occur when a method is called on an object that is `nil`, or when attempting to access a property or method of an object using the `[]` notation, and the object is `nil`. 

To resolve this issue, ensure that the object is not `nil` before calling the method or accessing its properties/methods. You can use conditional statements or error handling mechanisms to check for the presence of the object before performing any operations on it. 

## Relevant Code Snippet
```ruby
say @pastel.green("Workflow completed successfully")
```

In the above code, `@pastel` is `nil`, leading to the error.
