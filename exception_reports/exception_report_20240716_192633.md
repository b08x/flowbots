# ðŸ¤– FlowBot Exception Report ðŸ¤–


## Summary:
An error has occurred in the Flowbots CLI, failing to create a topic model.

## Technical Details:
Unfortunately, I was unable to find any specific information about the error "Failed to create topic model" in the context of Flowbots CLI. The backtrace you provided suggests that the error occurred during the topic modelling process, specifically in the `TopicModelProcessor.rb` file. However, without further context or code snippets, it is challenging to pinpoint the exact cause of the error.

To resolve the issue, I recommend reviewing the `TopicModelProcessor.rb` file, particularly the `load_model` method, and checking for any potential issues or errors that could have led to the failure in creating the topic model.
