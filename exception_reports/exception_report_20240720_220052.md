# ðŸ¤– FlowBot Exception Report ðŸ¤–


## Summary
An error occurred when attempting to call the `green` method on `nil`.

## Technical Details
The error was raised when attempting to execute the following code:

```ruby
say @pastel.green("Workflow completed successfully")
```

The error message indicates that the `green` method is undefined for `nil`. This suggests that `@pastel` is `nil`, and therefore the `green` method cannot be called on it.

To resolve this issue, ensure that `@pastel` is initialized correctly before attempting to access the `green` method. You may need to check the value of `@pastel` prior to the method call to ensure it is not `nil`.


## Exception Details

- **Class:** Flowbots::CLI
- **Message:** undefined method `green' for nil:NilClass

          say @pastel.green("Workflow completed successfully")
                     ^^^^^^
