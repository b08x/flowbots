# ðŸ¤– FlowBot Exception Report ðŸ¤–


## Summary
An error has occurred in the Flowbots::CLI class, indicating that a specific file cannot be found in the designated directory.

## Technical Details
The error message "No such file or directory @ rb_sysopen" indicates that the program attempted to access a file that does not exist in the specified location. In this case, the file in question is '/home/b08x/Workspace/Prompt Repository/Practical Thought Experiments For Micro-Agent Simulations.md'.

### Backtrace
The error occurred within the `read` method of the `TextProcessingWorkflow` class in the `text_processing_workflow.rb` file. This file is located at `/home/b08x/Workspace/flowbots/lib/workflows/text_processing_workflow.rb`. The issue then propagated through multiple modules and classes before ultimately being raised in the `CLI` class in the `cli.rb` file.

### Relevant Files
The provided code snippets include portions of the `text_processing_workflow.rb` and `cli.rb` files, which are relevant to the error.

## Potential Solutions
- Verify the file path: Double-check the file path to ensure that it is correct and that the file exists in the specified location.
- Check file permissions: Ensure that the program has the necessary permissions to access the file.
- Handle file absence gracefully: Modify the code to include error handling for cases where the file is missing or inaccessible.
