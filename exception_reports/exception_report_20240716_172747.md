## Summary
The Flowbots application has encountered an error: "uninitialized constant TextProcessingWorkflow". This indicates that the TextProcessingWorkflow class or module has not been properly defined or imported, leading to a failure during the execution of the TextProcessingWorkflow.new(file) method.

## Technical Details

### Backtrace

- The run method was invoked by the workflows method in the CLI class (cli.rb, line 26).
- The workflows method was called by the dispatch method of Thor::Base (thor/invocation.rb).
- An exception occurred during the handle_help_switches method call in the start method of ThorExt::Start (thor_ext.rb, line 34).
