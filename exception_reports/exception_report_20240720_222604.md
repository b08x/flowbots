# ðŸ¤– FlowBot Exception Report ðŸ¤–


## Summary
An error occurred when attempting to execute a method on an object, where the method is not defined for the object. 

## Technical Details
In the provided code, the error is occurring on the following line:

```ruby
say @pastel.green("Workflow completed successfully")
```

The `@pastel` object is `nil`, and the `green` method cannot be called on a `nil` object. This results in the "undefined method `green' for nil:NilClass" error. 

To resolve this issue, ensure that the `@pastel` object is properly initialized and assigned before attempting to call the `green` method on it. 

## Relevant Code Snippet
```ruby
say @pastel.green("Workflow completed successfully")
```


## Exception Details

- **Class:** Flowbots::CLI
