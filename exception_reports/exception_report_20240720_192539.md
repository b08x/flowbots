# ðŸ¤– FlowBot Exception Report ðŸ¤–


## Summary
An error was encountered when attempting to execute the `say @pastel.green("Workflow completed successfully")` line in the `cli.rb` file. The specific issue is indicated by the "undefined method `green' for nil:NilClass" message, which means that the `@pastel` object is `nil` and does not have a `green` method defined.

## Technical Details
The error occurred within the `workflows` method of the `Flowbots::CLI` class in the `cli.rb` file. The `say @pastel.green("Workflow completed successfully")` line attempts to call the `green` method on the `@pastel` object to display a success message. However, the `@pastel` object is `nil`, meaning it has no value or is undefined, and therefore, the `green` method cannot be called on it.

To resolve this issue, you need to ensure that the `@pastel` object is properly initialized and has a valid value before attempting to access its `green` method. You can add a check to verify if `@pastel` is `nil` before calling the `green` method, or you can initialize `@pastel` with an appropriate value earlier in the code.

          say @pastel.green("Workflow completed successfully") # Error occurs here
        rescue FileNotFoundError => e
          say @pastel.red(e.message)
        rescue StandardError => e

### thor_ext.rb
This file contains the `ThorExt` module, which is extended by the `Flowbots::CLI` class in `cli.rb`. It provides additional functionality and error handling for Thor-based CLIs. However, the error does not appear to be directly related to the contents of this file.
