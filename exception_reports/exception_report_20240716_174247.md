# ðŸ¤– FlowBot Exception Report ðŸ¤–


## Summary:

An error occurred while executing the `flowbots` command-line interface (CLI) tool. The specific issue is an undefined method `new` for the string "TextProcessingWorkflow". This indicates that the system tried to call the `new` method on a string object, which is not defined, leading to a failure in executing the desired operation. 

## Technical Details: 

### Error Class and Message: 

- **Class:** Flowbots::CLI
- **Message:** undefined method `new' for "TextProcessingWorkflow":String

### Backtrace: 

The backtrace provides information about the sequence of method calls leading up to the error: 

- `/home/b08x/Workspace/flowbots/lib/workflows.rb:31:in `run''`: The error occurred within the `run` method of the `Workflows` class, specifically on line 31.
- `/home/b08x/Workspace/flowbots/lib/cli.rb:26:in `workflows''`: The error was triggered when executing the `workflows` method in the `CLI` class, on line 26.
- Thor command execution and invocation (`thor-1.3.1/lib/thor/command.rb` and `thor-1.3.1/lib/thor/invocation.rb`): Standard Thor library code for command handling.
- Custom Thor extension (`flowbots/lib/thor_ext.rb`): Custom extension for Thor behavior, including help and error handling.

### Relevant Files: 

- `workflows.rb`: This file contains the `Flowbots::Workflows` class, responsible for listing, selecting, and running workflows. 
- `cli.rb`: Defines the `Flowbots::CLI` class, a Thor-based command-line interface for interacting with the Flowbots system. 
- `command.rb`: Unrelated to the error; contains a separate module and class definition (`Sublayer::Actions::RunTestCommandAction`).
- `thor_ext.rb`: Custom Thor extension module, providing enhanced help and error-handling behavior. 

### Root Cause: 

The error occurred because the system expected the "TextProcessingWorkflow" to be an object with a `new` method, but it is actually a string. This suggests that there may be a misconfiguration, incorrect class definition, or missing dependency related to the "TextProcessingWorkflow". 

### Suggested Action Items: 

1. Review the `TextProcessingWorkflow` class definition and ensure it is correctly defined as a class, not a string. 
2. Check for any missing dependencies or required files that may be needed to define the "TextProcessingWorkflow" class. 
3. Verify that the `workflow_name` variable passed to the `run` method in `workflows.rb` is correct and matches the expected format for workflow names. 
4. Consider adding additional error handling or validation logic to catch and handle similar issues in the future. 

## Conclusion: 

This error report summarizes the undefined method issue encountered in the `flowbots` CLI tool. By addressing the root cause and implementing the suggested action items, the development team can resolve the error and improve the robustness of the Flowbots system.
