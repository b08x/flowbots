# ðŸ¤– FlowBot Exception Report ðŸ¤–


## Summary:

An error occurred while executing the `flowbots` command-line interface (CLI) tool. The specific issue is an undefined method called `constantize` for the string "TextProcessingWorkflow". This indicates that the program attempted to call a method that does not exist on a string object.

## Error Details: 

### Backtrace:

- **File:** *cli.rb*
   **Class:** Flowbots::CLI
   **Message:** undefined method `constantize' for "TextProcessingWorkflow":String

The relevant code snippet from *cli.rb*:

    workflow_class = TextProcessingWorkflow.new(file)
    workflow.run

### Relevant Files:

**workflows.rb:**
This file contains the `Flowbots::Workflows` class, which is responsible for listing, selecting, and running workflows. It includes methods for loading workflows, displaying them in a table, and handling file errors. 

**cli.rb:**
This file defines the `Flowbots::CLI` class, a Thor-based CLI that provides commands to list and run workflows. It also includes error handling using an `ExceptionHandler` module. 

**thor_ext.rb:**
This file provides a module `ThorExt::Start` that configures Thor to provide improved help and error handling for CLI tools. It includes methods for handling unknown arguments, help switches, and exceptions during the CLI's execution. 

## Suggested Action Items:

1. **Verify Method Existence:** Ensure that the "TextProcessingWorkflow" class exists and defines the `constantize` method. 
2. **Review Code Changes:** Compare the current code with any recent modifications to identify any accidental removals or renaming of the `constantize` method. 
3. **Check Dependencies:** Ensure that all required dependencies are installed and compatible with the current code. 
4. **Debug Workflow Execution:** Step through the workflow execution process to pinpoint where the undefined method is being called. 
5. **Consider Alternatives:** Depending on the specific use case, consider alternative approaches or workarounds to achieve the desired functionality. 

The team should review the provided code snippets and relevant files to identify and address the root cause of the error. Thorough testing and consideration of potential alternatives are recommended to prevent similar issues in the future.
