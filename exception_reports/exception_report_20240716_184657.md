# ðŸ¤– FlowBot Exception Report ðŸ¤–


## Summary: 
An error has occurred in the Flowbots CLI, indicating that a file was not found. This issue has caused the program to terminate unexpectedly. 

## Technical Details: 
### Backtrace: 
- The error occurred within the "Flowbots::CLI" module, specifically in the "prompt_for_file" method at line 43 of "text_processing_workflow.rb". 
- The error then propagated to the initialization method of the "TextProcessingWorkflow" class at line 14 of the same file. 
- Subsequent lines indicate the flow of execution, with the error eventually reaching the "run" method of the "CLI" class in "cli.rb" at line 28. 
- The backtrace highlights the sequence of method calls leading up to the error, providing context for the issue. 

### Relevant Files: 
- "text_processing_workflow.rb": This file contains the "TextProcessingWorkflow" class, which appears to handle text processing functionality. The error occurred during the initialization of an object of this class, specifically relating to file handling. 
- "workflows.rb": This file defines the "Workflows" class, which seems to handle workflow selection and execution. 
- "cli.rb": This file contains the "CLI" class, which is a part of the Flowbots module. The error was encountered while executing the "process_text" method within this class. 
- "thor_ext.rb": This file contains extensions for the Thor module, providing additional functionality for command-line interfaces. 

## Suggested Action Items: 
- Review the "text_processing_workflow.rb" file, specifically the "prompt_for_file" method at line 43. Ensure that the file being accessed exists and is accessible. 
- Consider implementing error handling mechanisms to gracefully manage cases where files are not found, providing more informative error messages, and allowing the program to continue execution if possible. 
- Examine the "Workflows" class in "workflows.rb" to ensure proper workflow selection and execution logic. 
- Analyze the "process_text" method in the "CLI" class of "cli.rb" for any potential issues related to file handling or workflow invocation. 

## Conclusion: 
The provided information indicates a "File not found" error within the Flowbots CLI. By examining the relevant files and backtrace, we can identify the source of the issue and implement appropriate solutions to prevent similar errors in the future.
