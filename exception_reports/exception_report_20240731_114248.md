## Error Report: Failed to Store Input File Path

**Summary:**

The Flowbots CLI encountered an error while attempting to store the input file path for the Text Processing Workflow. This prevented the workflow from running successfully.

**Technical Details:**

* **Class:** Flowbots::CLI
* **Message:** Error storing input file path: Failed to create or find Sourcefile

**Backtrace:**

The error originated in the `store_input_file_path` method of the `TextProcessingWorkflow` class (`text_processing_workflow.rb:44`). This method is called during the `run` method of the workflow (`text_processing_workflow.rb:15`). 

The backtrace indicates that the error occurred while attempting to access the Redis store through the `Jongleur::WorkerTask` class variable `@@redis` (`text_processing_workflow.rb:57`).

**Possible Causes:**

* **Redis Connection Issue:** The application may not be able to connect to the Redis instance. 
* **Incorrect Redis Configuration:** The Redis connection details (host, port, password) may be incorrect.
* **Jongleur Worker Task Issue:** There might be an issue with how the `Jongleur::WorkerTask` class interacts with Redis, potentially due to a missing initialization or incorrect configuration.

**Recommended Actions:**

1. **Verify Redis Connection:** Check if the application can successfully connect to the Redis instance.
2. **Review Redis Configuration:** Ensure that the Redis connection details are accurate and accessible by the application.
3. **Investigate Jongleur Worker Task:** Investigate the `Jongleur::WorkerTask` class to ensure it correctly initializes and interacts with the Redis instance. Check for any potential errors or exceptions within the `Jongleur` library.

**Relevant Files:**

* `text_processing_workflow.rb`
* `cli.rb` 
* `command.rb`
* `thor_ext.rb`

This report provides a starting point for debugging the issue. Further investigation is required to pinpoint the exact cause of the error and implement a solution.
