# ðŸ¤– FlowBot Exception Report ðŸ¤–


## Summary
The error "uninitialized constant TextProcessingWorkflow" occurred in the Flowbots::CLI class. This indicates that the TextProcessingWorkflow class could not be found by the interpreter, resulting in the failure of the object creation using Object.const_get.

## Technical Details

### Backtrace
- The error occurred during the execution of the "run" method in the Workflows class of the "workflows.rb" file.
- The "run" method is invoked by the "workflows" method in the CLI class of the "cli.rb" file.
- The "workflows" method handles the selection and execution of a workflow, including error handling.
- The specific line causing the error is: "workflow = Object.const_get(workflow_class).new(workflow_file)".

### Potential Cause
The most likely cause of the error is that the TextProcessingWorkflow class is not properly defined or is not accessible to the interpreter.

### Suggested Solution
- Check the definition of the TextProcessingWorkflow class and ensure it is located in the expected file and directory.
- Verify that the file containing the TextProcessingWorkflow class is properly included or required in the appropriate location.
- Ensure that the class name and module structure match the file and directory structure, following the Ruby conventions for constant lookup.
