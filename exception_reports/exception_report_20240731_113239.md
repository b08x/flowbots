## Error Report: Flowbots CLI - Undefined Method 'id' for TrueClass

**Summary:**

The Flowbots CLI encountered an error while attempting to store the input file path. The system attempted to call the 'id' method on a boolean value (true:TrueClass), which is not a valid method for that data type, resulting in a crash.

**Technical Details:**

* **Class:** Flowbots::CLI
* **Message:**  Error storing input file path: undefined method `id' for true:TrueClass
* **Location:** `/home/b08x/Workspace/flowbots/lib/workflows/text_processing_workflow.rb:57` in method `store_input_file_path`

**Code Snippet:**

```ruby
        send(writer, value ? value.id : nil)
                                  ^^^
```

**Backtrace:**

The error originated within the `store_input_file_path` method of the `TextProcessingWorkflow` class.  It was triggered during the execution of the `process_text` command in the CLI. 

**Relevant Files:**

* `text_processing_workflow.rb`
* `cli.rb`
* `command.rb`
* `thor_ext.rb`

**Analysis:**

The error suggests that the `value` variable in the `store_input_file_path` method is being passed a boolean value (`true`) instead of an object with an `id` method. This likely indicates a logical error in how the input file path is being handled or passed between methods.

**Next Steps:**

1. Investigate the `store_input_file_path` method to identify why a boolean value is being assigned to the `value` variable.
2. Trace the origin of the `value` variable back through the call stack to determine where the incorrect assignment occurs.
3. Implement appropriate checks and/or data type validation to ensure that the `value` variable in the `store_input_file_path` method always receives an object with an `id` method. 
4. Perform thorough testing to confirm the resolution of the error and prevent similar issues in the future.
