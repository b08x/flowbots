# ðŸ¤– FlowBot Exception Report ðŸ¤–


## Error Report Summary
An error has occurred in the Flowbots::CLI class, specifically in the TextProcessingWorkflow class. The error message indicates that the wrong number of arguments was passed to the initialize method, expecting 1 argument but receiving 0.

## Technical Details
### Backtrace
The backtrace provides information about the sequence of method calls leading up to the error:
- The initialize method in TextProcessingWorkflow.rb is called with 0 arguments, but it expects 1 argument.
- The new method in workflows.rb invokes the initialize method with the incorrect number of arguments.
- The run method in workflows.rb invokes the new method, propagating the error.
- The workflows method in cli.rb invokes the run method, continuing the error propagation.
- The start method in thor_ext.rb handles command-line arguments and dispatching, ultimately leading to the error being raised.

### Relevant Files
- text_processing_workflow.rb: Defines the TextProcessingWorkflow class, including the initialize method where the error occurred.
- workflows.rb: Contains the Workflows class and the run method, which invokes the TextProcessingWorkflow class with the incorrect number of arguments.
- cli.rb: Implements the CLI class and the workflows method, which calls the run method in workflows.rb.
- thor_ext.rb: Provides the Start module, extending the behavior of Thor to handle command-line arguments and dispatching.
