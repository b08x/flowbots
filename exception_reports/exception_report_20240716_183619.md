# ðŸ¤– FlowBot Exception Report ðŸ¤–


## Summary
The error "No such file or directory @ rb_sysopen" occurred when attempting to access a file during the execution of a Ruby script.

## Technical Details
The specific error message, including the file path, is as follows:

> No such file or directory @ rb_sysopen - /home/b08x/Workspace/Prompt Repository/Practical Thought Experiments For Micro-Agent Simulations.md

This error indicates that the program attempted to access a file located at the specified path, but the file could not be found. The backtrace provides additional context:

```

The relevant code snippet from `text_processing_workflow.rb` is:

```ruby
def process_input
  logger.debug "Processing input file: #{@input_file_path}"
  text = File.read(@input_file_path)
  processed_text = @nlp_processor.process(text)
  store_processed_text(processed_text)
  logger.debug "Input processing completed"
end
```

In this code, the `File.read` method is used to read the contents of the file specified by `@input_file_path`. However, since the file could not be found, the error was raised.

## Possible Solutions
- Verify the file path: Ensure that the specified file path, `/home/b08x/Workspace/Prompt Repository/Practical Thought Experiments For Micro-Agent Simulations.md`, is correct and that the file exists at that location.
- Check file permissions: Ensure that the program has the necessary permissions to access the file.
- Handle file absence: Modify the code to include error handling or conditional checks to handle the case where the file is absent or inaccessible.
