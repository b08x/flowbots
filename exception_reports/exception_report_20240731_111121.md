# ðŸ¤– FlowBot Exception Report ðŸ¤–


## Summary
An error has occurred in the Flowbots::CLI class, resulting in an "uninitialized constant" issue specifically related to WorkflowOrchestrator::WorkflowAgent.

## Technical Details
The error is likely due to one of the following reasons:
- Missing require statement: The code may be missing a require statement to load the file containing the WorkflowAgent class definition.
- Misspelled constant name: There could be a typo in the WorkflowAgent constant name when it is referenced in the code.
- Scope issues: The WorkflowAgent constant may be defined within a different scope, such as another class or module, and is not being properly referenced.
- Loading order: The constant might be referenced before its definition is loaded or executed.

## Backtrace
The error occurred within the following code block:
```ruby
@agents[:task_manager] = WorkflowAgent.new("task_manager", "task_manager_cartridge.yml")
```

## Relevant Files
The following files are potentially relevant to the issue:
- WorkflowOrchestrator.rb: This file contains the WorkflowOrchestrator class, where the error occurred.
- text_processing_workflow.rb: This file defines the TextProcessingWorkflow class, which uses the WorkflowOrchestrator class.
- cli.rb: This file contains the CLI class and includes the process_text method, which triggers the TextProcessingWorkflow.
- command.rb: This file does not appear to be directly related to the issue, as it pertains to Sublayer::Actions rather than WorkflowOrchestrator.
- thor_ext.rb: This file contains extensions for the Thor CLI framework, providing enhanced error handling and argument parsing. While it doesn't directly cause the issue, it may have an impact on how errors are handled and displayed.

## Suggested Actions
To resolve the issue, consider the following actions:
- Verify the presence and correctness of require statements in the relevant files, especially those related to loading the WorkflowAgent class.
- Double-check the spelling and casing of the WorkflowAgent constant name throughout the codebase.
- Ensure proper scoping by checking if the WorkflowAgent constant is defined within the appropriate scope (class or module) and is correctly referenced.
- Review the loading order of the code and ensure that the WorkflowAgent constant is defined before it is referenced.


## Exception Details

- **Class:** Flowbots::CLI
