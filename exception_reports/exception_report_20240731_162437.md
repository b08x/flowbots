## Error Report: Undefined Method `update` for Workflow:Class

**Summary:** 

The application encountered a fatal error during the execution of a workflow. The error message "undefined method `update` for Workflow:Class" indicates an attempt to call the `update` method on a class object instead of an instance of the Workflow class. 

**Technical Details:**

* **Error Class:** Flowbots::CLI
* **Error Message:** undefined method `update` for Workflow:Class
* **Root Cause:**  The error originates in the `WorkflowOrchestrator.rb` file, specifically on line 48 within the `run_workflow` method. The line `@workflow.update(status: "running")` attempts to update the status of the `@workflow` object. However, it appears that `@workflow` is referencing the Workflow class itself instead of an instance of the class. 
* **Affected Code:**
    * **WorkflowOrchestrator.rb:** Line 48 (`run_workflow` method)
    * **text_processing_workflow.rb:** Line 23 (`run` method)
* **Possible Solution:**
    Ensure that the `@workflow` variable in `WorkflowOrchestrator` is properly initialized with a Workflow object instance before the `run_workflow` method is called. This likely requires reviewing the `setup_workflow` method within `text_processing_workflow.rb` and ensuring it returns and sets a valid Workflow instance. 

**Next Steps:**

1. **Verify Workflow Initialization:** Debug the `setup_workflow` method to confirm a Workflow object is being created and returned correctly.
2. **Inspect `@workflow` Assignment:** Confirm that the returned Workflow object is properly assigned to the `@workflow` instance variable within the relevant `text_processing_workflow.rb` code.
3. **Review Related Code:** Examine the `store_input_file_path` method in `text_processing_workflow.rb` as it interacts with the workflow object and could potentially influence its state.

This error highlights a critical issue that prevents workflow execution. Immediate action is required to address the root cause and implement the necessary corrections.
