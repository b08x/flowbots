# ðŸ¤– FlowBot Exception Report ðŸ¤–


## Error Report: Cartridge File Not Found

**Summary:**

The application failed to locate a required cartridge file, "task_manager_cartridge.yml", resulting in an error during workflow initialization. 

**Technical Details:**

* **Class:** Flowbots::CLI
* **Message:** Cartridge file not found: "/home/b08x/Workspace/flowbots/nano-bots/cartridges/@b08x/cartridges/task_manager_cartridge.yml"
* **Affected Component:** WorkflowAgent initialization during workflow setup. 

**Root Cause:**

The specified cartridge file, crucial for the WorkflowAgent's operation, is absent at the provided path. This could be due to:

* **Incorrect File Path:** The path to the cartridge file might be mistyped or outdated.
* **Missing File:**  The cartridge file may have been accidentally deleted or is not present in the expected location. 
* **Version Control Issues:**  Recent changes in the codebase might not have been properly pulled or synchronized, leading to a missing file.

**Relevant Code Snippets:**

* **WorkflowAgent.rb:**  The `initialize` method attempts to load the cartridge file using the provided path.
```ruby
class WorkflowAgent
  def initialize(role, cartridge_file)
    # ...
    @bot = NanoBot.new(
      cartridge: cartridge_file
    )
    # ...
  end
  # ...
end
```

* **WorkflowOrchestrator.rb:** This class is responsible for adding the agent and checking for the cartridge file existence.
```ruby 
class WorkflowOrchestrator
  # ...
  def add_agent(role, cartridge_file, author: "@b08x")
    # ...
    cartridge_path = File.join(CARTRIDGE_BASE_DIR, author, "cartridges", cartridge_file)

    unless File.exist?(cartridge_path)
      logger.error "Cartridge file not found: \"#{cartridge_path}\""
      raise "Cartridge file not found: \"#{cartridge_path}\""
    end
    # ...
  end
  # ... 
end
```

**Next Steps:**

1. **Verify Cartridge File Path:** Ensure the file path specified in the `WorkflowAgent` initialization is accurate and up-to-date. 
2. **Confirm File Existence:** Check if the file "task_manager_cartridge.yml" exists at the expected location within the project structure.
3. **Version Control Check:** If the file is missing, review the version control history and, if necessary, pull the latest changes to ensure the file is present. 
4. **Investigate Recent Changes:**  If the file was recently added or modified, examine the changes for potential errors.

Once the issue with the cartridge file is resolved, the workflow should initialize and run successfully.
