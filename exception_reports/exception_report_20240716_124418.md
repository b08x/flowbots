# ðŸ¤– FlowBot Exception Report ðŸ¤–


## Error Report: Task Graph Execution Failure

**Summary:**

The Flowbots application encountered a critical error during workflow execution. The error message "Not all the tasks in the Task Graph are implemented as WorkerTask classes" indicates a configuration issue within the defined workflow. 

**Technical Details:**

* **Class:** Flowbots::CLI
* **Message:** Not all the tasks in the Task Graph are implemented as WorkerTask classes
* **Relevant Code:**
    * `text_processing_workflow.rb`: This file defines the workflow graph and attempts to execute tasks within it.
    * `WorkflowOrchestrator.rb`: This class is responsible for managing agents and executing the defined workflow graph using the Jongleur library.
* **Backtrace Analysis:** 
    * The error originates from the `Jongleur::API.run` call within the `WorkflowOrchestrator.run_workflow` method. This suggests that the Jongleur library, responsible for managing the task graph, identified that not all defined tasks were properly set up for execution as WorkerTask classes.
* **Potential Cause:**
    * The workflow graph defined in `text_processing_workflow.rb` likely references task names (e.g., `:NlpAnalysisTask`, `:TopicModelingTask`) that are not defined as classes inheriting from `Jongleur::WorkerTask`.  

**Next Steps:**

1. **Verify Task Class Definitions:** Review `text_processing_workflow.rb` and confirm that classes like `NlpAnalysisTask`, `TopicModelingTask`, and `LlmAnalysisTask` are defined and inherit from `Jongleur::WorkerTask`.
2. **Ensure Task Registration:** If the classes exist, verify they are properly registered with Jongleur to enable their execution within the task graph.
3. **Code Inspection:**  Thoroughly examine the code involved in defining and executing the workflow, paying close attention to task class definitions and how they are integrated with the Jongleur library.

**Recommendations:**

* Implement comprehensive error handling within the workflow execution process to provide more informative messages in case of misconfiguration.
* Introduce automated checks during workflow definition to validate task class implementation and registration, preventing such errors during runtime.
