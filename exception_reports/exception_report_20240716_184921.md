# ðŸ¤– FlowBot Exception Report ðŸ¤–


## Summary
The error "No such file or directory @ rb_sysopen" indicates that the program attempted to access a file that does not exist in the specified directory.

## Technical Details
The backtrace suggests that the error occurred during the execution of the "flowbots" command-line interface (CLI) tool. Specifically, it happened during the "process_input" step of the "TextProcessingWorkflow" class in the "text_processing_workflow.rb" file.

The relevant code snippet from "text_processing_workflow.rb" is:

```ruby
def process_input
  logger.debug "Processing input file: #{@input_file_path}"
  text = File.read(@input_file_path)
  processed_text = @nlp_processor.process(text)
  store_processed_text(processed_text)
  logger.debug "Input processing completed"
end
```

In this code, the "File.read" method is used to read the contents of the file specified by "@input_file_path". However, the error message indicates that the file could not be found in the given path.

## Suggested Action
To resolve this issue, ensure that the file specified by "@input_file_path" exists in the expected location. Verify the file path and check for any typos or incorrect directory references. Additionally, confirm that the file is accessible by the program and that any necessary permissions are granted.
