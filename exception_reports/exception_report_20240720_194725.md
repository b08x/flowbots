# ðŸ¤– FlowBot Exception Report ðŸ¤–


## Summary
An error occurred when attempting to execute the `say @pastel.green("Workflow completed successfully")` code in the `cli.rb` file. This error, `undefined method 'green' for nil:NilClass`, indicates that the method or attribute being called on an object has not been defined. 

## Technical Details
The `green` method is undefined for the object `nil`, which is a special type in Ruby representing the absence of a value. This error suggests that `@pastel` is `nil`, indicating that it has not been assigned a value. 

To resolve this issue, ensure that `@pastel` is assigned a valid value before attempting to call the `green` method on it. You can use a conditional statement, such as an `if-else` block, to check if `@pastel` is `nil` before executing the code that references it. 

## Relevant Code Snippet
```ruby
if selected_workflow
  begin
    workflows.run(selected_workflow)
    say @pastel.green("Workflow completed successfully")
  rescue FileNotFoundError => e
    say @pastel.red(e.message)
  rescue StandardError => e
    ExceptionHandler.handle_exception(self.class.name, e)
  end
end
```
