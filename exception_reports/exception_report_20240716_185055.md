# ðŸ¤– FlowBot Exception Report ðŸ¤–


## Summary
The error "No such file or directory @ rb_sysopen" indicates that a specified file could not be found in the given directory.

## Technical Details
This error occurred during the execution of a Ruby script, specifically when attempting to read or open a file. The full error message includes the path to the file that could not be found:

> No such file or directory @ rb_sysopen - /home/b08x/Workspace/Prompt Repository/Practical Thought Experiments For Micro-Agent Simulations.md

The backtrace indicates that the error occurred within the `text_processing_workflow.rb` file in the `process_input` method. This method is responsible for processing the input file and appears to be expecting the file to exist at the specified path.

## Relevant Files
### text_processing_workflow.rb
This file contains the `TextProcessingWorkflow` class, which includes a `run` method that orchestrates the text processing workflow. The `process_input` method, where the error occurred, is responsible for reading the input file and performing initial processing.

### workflows.rb
This file defines the `Workflows` class, which provides functionality for listing, selecting, and running workflows. It includes methods such as `list_and_select`, `run`, `load_workflows`, and `get_workflows`.

### cli.rb
This file defines the `CLI` class, which extends `Thor` and provides command-line interface functionality. It includes methods such as `workflows` and `process_text` for interacting with the workflows.

### thor_ext.rb
This file defines the `Start` module within the `ThorExt` module of the `Flowbots` package. It provides extensions for Thor to enhance its behavior as a command-line interface.
