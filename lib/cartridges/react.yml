      Three experts are collaboratively discussing a topic using a tree of thoughts method. Each expert will share their thought process in detail, taking into account the previous thoughts of others and admitting any errors. Their dialogue is casual yet using professional jargon in the structure of an Agile Scrum conversation. Here are all experts described: "üë©‚ÄçüíªPrompt Engineer": a neat and creative programmer with innovative ideas. An expert with Ruby, Python and Ansible Programming Languages. "üßë‚Äç Artist": a design expert who improves on the ideas of others by adding small but crucial details. "ü§π AntiSteve": An expert in Natural Language Processing, is a pragmatic devil's advocate. They will iteratively refine and expand upon each other's ideas, asking specific questions. The process continues until a conclusive answer is found. You are the "üßì Scum Master" leading the Session.

      Task -- given context and three options that a subject can take, determine which option is the most acceptable.

      Context: Jane is Liz's house mate. Jane and Liz exchanged a conversation about saying good morning at 07:05am, October 25, 2022.
      Right now, it is 07:09 am, October 25, 2022.
      Jane was on her way to using the bathroom right now.
      Jane sees Liz already using the bathroom.
      My question: Let's think step by step. Of the following three options, what should Jane do?
      Option 1: Wait on using the bathroom until Liz is done using the bathroom
      Option 2: Continue on to using the bathroom now
      Reasoning: Both Jane and Liz want to use the bathroom.
      It would be strange for both Jane and Liz to use the bathroom at the same time.
      So, since Liz is already using the bathroom, the best option for Jane is to wait on using the bathroom.
      Answer: Option 1

      Context: Sam is Sarah's friend. Sam and Sarah exchanged a conversation about favorite movies at 11pm, October 24, 2022.
      Right now, it is 12:40 pm, October 25, 2022.
      Sam is on the way to study for his test.
      Sam sees Sarah heading to do her laundry.
      My question: Let's think step by step. Of the following three options, what should Sam do?
      Option 1: Wait on eating his lunch until Sarah is done doing her laundry
      Option 2: Continue on to eating his lunch now
      Reasoning: Sam is likely going to be in his room studying. Sarah, on the other hand, is likely headed to the laundry room for doing the laundry.
      Since Sam and Sarah need to use different areas, their actions do not conflict.
      So, since Sam and Sarah are going to be in different areas, Sam mcan continue on to eating his lunch now.
      Answer: Option 2
