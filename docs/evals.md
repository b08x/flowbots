# Key Features of Agenta that Complement Multi-Actor Workflows

Agenta provides several features that can significantly enhance multi-actor workflows, especially in the context of NLP prompt evaluations. Here are the key features and how they can be integrated with other components like Nano Bots, Jongleur, FlowiseAI, and Langfuse:

#### 1. **Automatic Evaluation**
Agenta offers tools for automatic evaluation of NLP prompts. This feature is crucial for assessing the performance of different agents in a multi-actor workflow. Automatic evaluation can be used to provide immediate feedback on the quality of responses generated by agents.

- **Integration**: Automatic evaluation results can be stored in Redis and accessed by subsequent tasks in the workflow managed by Jongleur. This ensures that each agent's output is evaluated and optimized before being passed to the next agent.

#### 2. **Human Feedback**
Agenta allows for the incorporation of human feedback in the evaluation process. This is particularly useful for refining prompts and improving the overall quality of agent interactions.

- **Integration**: Human feedback can be integrated into the workflow by creating a feedback loop where human evaluators review and rate the responses generated by agents. This feedback can be stored and used to adjust the agents' behavior dynamically.

#### 3. **Customizable Metrics**
Agenta supports customizable evaluation metrics, enabling you to tailor the evaluation process to specific requirements. This flexibility allows for more precise and relevant assessments of agent performance.

- **Integration**: Customizable metrics can be defined and used within the Jongleur tasks to evaluate specific aspects of agent responses. These metrics can be adjusted based on the workflow's needs and the nature of the tasks being performed by the agents.

#### 4. **Scalability**
Agenta is designed to handle large-scale evaluations, making it suitable for workflows involving multiple agents and large datasets. This scalability ensures that the evaluation process remains efficient even as the complexity of the workflow increases.

- **Integration**: The scalability of Agenta can be leveraged by distributing the evaluation tasks across multiple Jongleur workers. This parallel processing capability ensures that evaluations are performed quickly and efficiently.

### Integration with Other Components

#### 1. **Nano Bots**
Nano Bots can be used to implement individual agents with specific roles and capabilities. Each agent can be defined as a Jongleur task, and their interactions can be managed within the workflow.

```ruby
class ResearcherAgent < Jongleur::WorkerTask
  def execute
    agent = NanoBot.new(role: 'researcher')
    result = agent.process("Research on AI advancements")
    @@redis.set("research_result", result.to_json)
  end
end
```

#### 2. **Jongleur**
Jongleur manages the workflow orchestration and state management. It handles task dependencies and parallel execution of agent tasks, ensuring that the workflow proceeds smoothly.

```ruby
workflow_graph = {
  ResearcherAgent: [:WriterAgent],
  WriterAgent: [:EvaluatorAgent]
}

Jongleur::API.add_task_graph(workflow_graph)
```

#### 3. **FlowiseAI**
FlowiseAI provides a visual interface for designing and managing workflows. It allows users to configure agent interactions and data flow easily, making the workflow design process more intuitive.

#### 4. **Langfuse**
Langfuse implements logging and monitoring for the entire system. It provides insights into agent performance and workflow efficiency, helping to identify and address any issues that arise during execution.

### Example Workflow

1. **Extract Task**: Tokenize input text using `pragmatic_tokenizer` and store tokens in Redis.
2. **Transform Task**: Perform part-of-speech tagging, morphology analysis, and subject extraction using `ruby-spacy`.
3. **Evaluation Task**: Evaluate the NLP prompts using Agenta's automatic evaluation tools and store the results.
4. **Feedback Task**: Incorporate human feedback into the evaluation process and adjust agent behavior accordingly.
5. **Load Task**: Format the results as JSONL and save them to an output file.

```ruby
class Extract < Jongleur::WorkerTask
  def execute
    tokenizer = PragmaticTokenizer::Tokenizer.new
    tokens = tokenizer.tokenize(@text)
    @@redis.set("tokens", tokens.to_json)
  end
end

class Transform < Jongleur::WorkerTask
  def execute
    nlp = Spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')
    tokens = JSON.parse(@@redis.get("tokens"))
    doc = nlp.pipe(tokens.join(" "))
    analysis = doc.to_a.map { |token| { text: token.text, lemma: token.lemma_, pos: token.pos_ } }
    @@redis.set("analysis", analysis.to_json)
  end
end

class Evaluate < Jongleur::WorkerTask
  def execute
    analysis = JSON.parse(@@redis.get("analysis"))
    evaluation_result = Agenta.evaluate(analysis)
    @@redis.set("evaluation_result", evaluation_result.to_json)
  end
end

class Load < Jongleur::WorkerTask
  def execute
    evaluation_result = @@redis.get("evaluation_result")
    File.open("output.jsonl", 'w') { |file| file.puts(evaluation_result) }
  end
end
```

### Summary

By combining Nano Bots, Jongleur, Agenta, FlowiseAI, and Langfuse, you can create a robust and user-friendly platform for developing and deploying stateful multi-actor agent workflows. Agenta's key features, such as automatic evaluation, human feedback, customizable metrics, and scalability, complement the multi-actor workflows by providing comprehensive evaluation capabilities. This integration ensures that the platform is efficient, scalable, and capable of handling complex NLP prompt evaluations.
