In this document, we will explain how to use agenta to quickly evaluate and compare the performance of your LLM applications.\nConfiguring Evaluators\nAgenta comes with a set of built-in evaluators that can be configured.\nBy default, each project includes the following evaluators (which do not require configuration):\n\nExact match: This evaluator checks if the generated answer is an exact match to the expected answer. The aggregated result is the percentage of correct answers.\n\nAdditionally, the following configurable evaluators are available but need to be explicitly configured and added before use.\nTo add an evaluator, go to the Evaluators tab and click on the “Add Evaluator” button. A modal will appear where you can select the evaluator you want to add and configure it.\n\n\n\nConfigurable evaluators\n\nRegex match: This evaluator checks if the generated answer matches a regular expression pattern. You need to provide the regex expression and specify whether an answer is correct if it matches or does not match the regex.\nWebhook evaluator: This evaluator sends the generated answer and the correct_answer to a webhook and expects a response indicating the correctness of the answer. You need to provide the URL of the webhook.\nSimilarity Match evaluator: This evaluator checks if the generated answer is similar to the expected answer. You need to provide the similarity threshold. It uses the Jaccard similarity to compare the answers.\nAI Critic evaluator: This evaluator sends the generated answer and the correct_answer to an LLM model and uses it to evaluate the correctness of the answer. You need to provide the evaluation prompt (or use the default prompt).\nCustom code evaluator: This evaluator allows you to write your own evaluator in Python. You need to provide the Python code for the evaluator. More details can be found here.\n\nBegin Evaluation\nTo start an evaluation, go to the Evaluations page and click on the “Begin Evaluation Now” button. A modal will appear where you can fine-tune the evaluation based on your specific requirements.\nIn the modal, you need to specify the following parameters:\n\nTestset: Choose the testset you want to use for the evaluation.\nVariants: Select one or more variants you wish to evaluate.\nEvaluators: Choose one or more evaluators for the assessment.\n\n\nAdvanced Configuration\nAdditional configurations for batching and retrying LLM calls are available in the advanced configuration section. You can specify the following parameters:\n\nBatch Size: Set the number of testsets to include in each batch (default is 10).\nRetry Delay: Define the delay before retrying a failed language model call (in seconds, default is 3).\nMax Retries: Specify the maximum number of retries for a failed language model call (default is 3).\nDelay Between Batches: Set the delay between running batches (in seconds, default is 5).\n\nIn addition to the batching and retrying configurations, you can also specify the following parameters:\n\nCorrect Answer Column: Specify the column in the test set containing the correct/expected answer (default is correct_answer).\n\n\nView Evaluation Result\nTo view the result of an evaluation, double-click on the evaluation row once you have clicked the “Create” button and the evaluation status is set to “completed”. This will give you access to the detailed evaluation results.\n\nCompare Evaluations\nWhen the evaluation status is set to “completed”, you can select two or more evaluations from the same testset to compare. Click on the “Compare” button, and you will be taken to the Evaluation comparison view where you can compare the output of two or more evaluations."},{"url":"/user/files/1720219832636_2520238219202549.txt","size":2232,"name":"Writing Custom Evaluators - Agenta AI - docs.agenta.ai - 1720219832632.html","created":1720219832654,"text":"Sometimes, the default evaluators on Agenta may not be sufficient for your specific use case.

Langfuse comes with a list of predefined popular models and their tokenizers including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google models. You can also add your own custom model definitions or request official support for new models via GitHub. Inferred cost are calculated at the time of ingestion.\n\nIngested usage and cost are prioritized over inferred usage and cost:\n\nVia the Daily Metrics API, you can retrieve aggregated daily usage and cost metrics from Langfuse for downstream use in analytics, billing, and rate-limiting. The API allows you to filter by application type, user, or tags.\nIngest usage and/or cost\nIf available in the LLM response, ingesting usage and/or cost is the most accurate and robust way to track usage in Langfuse.\nMany of the Langfuse integrations automatically capture usage and cost data from the LLM response. If this does not work as expected, please create an issue on GitHub.\n\nYou can also update the usage and cost via generation.update() and generation.end().\nCompatibility with OpenAI\nFor increased compatibility with OpenAI, you can also use the following attributes to ingest usage:\n\nYou can also ingest OpenAI-style usage via generation.update() and generation.end().\nInfer usage and/or cost\nIf either usage or cost are not ingested, Langfuse will attempt to infer the missing values based on the model parameter of the generation at the time of ingestion. This is especially useful for some model providers or self-hosted models which do not include usage or cost in the response.\nLangfuse comes with a list of predefined popular models and their tokenizers including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google. Check out the full list (opens in a new tab) (you need to sign-in).\nYou can also add your own custom model definitions (see below) or request official support for new models via GitHub.\nUsage\nIf a tokenizer is specified for the model, Langfuse automatically calculates token amounts for ingested generations.\nThe following tokenizers are currently supported:\n\nCost\nModel definitions include prices per unit (input, output, total).\nLangfuse automatically calculates cost for ingested generations at the time of ingestion if (1) usage is ingested or inferred, (2) and a matching model definition includes prices.\nCustom model definitions\nYou can flexibly add your own model definitions to Langfuse. This is especially useful for self-hosted or fine-tuned models which are not included in the list of Langfuse maintained models.\n\nModels are matched to generations based on:\n\nUser-defined models take priority over models maintained by Langfuse.\nFurther details\nWhen using the openai tokenizer, you need to specify the following tokenization config. You can also copy the config from the list of predefined OpenAI models. See the OpenAI documentation (opens in a new tab) for further details. tokensPerName and tokensPerMessage are required for chat models.\n\nTroubleshooting\nUsage and cost are missing for historical generations. Except for changes in prices, Langfuse does not retroactively infer usage and cost for existing generations when model definitions are changed. You can request a batch job (Langfuse Cloud) or run a script (self-hosting) to apply new model definitions to existing generations.Daily Metrics APIOverviewWas this page useful?Questions?

Usually teams use a multitude of different evaluation methods depending on the use case and the stage of the development process. Langfuse provides a flexible scoring system to capture these evaluations and make them actionable.\nCommon evaluation methods\nLangfuse supports all forms of evaluation methods due to its open architecture and API, learn more on the score object in the next section.\nDepending on your needs in the development process, you can use one or multiple of the following evaluation methods. Each method will vary in: frequency, cost, and quality. usually only a combination of multiple methods will provide a comprehensive evaluation of the LLM application.\n\nScore object in Langfuse\nScores serve as an object to store evaluation metrics in Langfuse. They always are related to a trace and can be attached to specific observations within a trace. Optionally, scores can be related to a score config to ensure they comply with a specific schema.\n\nUsing scores across Langfuse\nScores can be used in multiple ways across Langfuse:\n\nDisplayed on trace to provide a quick overview\nSegment all execution traces by scores to e.g. find all traces with a low quality score\nAnalytics: Detailed score reporting with drill downs into use cases and user segments\n\nConfigure score schema\nIf you'd like to ensure that your scores follow a specific schema, you can define a score config in the Langfuse UI or via our API. A score config includes the score name, data type, and constraints on score value range such as min and max values for numerical data types and custom categories for categorical data types. Configs are immutable but can be archived (and restored anytime). Using score configs allows you to standardize your scoring schema across your team and ensure that scores are consistent and comparable for future analysis.\nFrequently used scores\nScores in Langfuse are adaptable (it is just a name) and designed to cater to the unique requirements of specific LLM applications. They typically serve to measure the following aspects:\n\nQuality\n\nFactual accuracy\nCompleteness of the information provided\nVerification against hallucinations\n\n\nStyle\n\nSentiment portrayed\nTonality of the content\nPotential toxicity\n\n\nSecurity\n\nSimilarity to prevalent prompt injections\nInstances of model refusals (e.g., as a language model, ...)\n\n\n\nThis flexible scoring system allows for a comprehensive evaluation of various elements integral to the function and performance of the LLM application.Model Usage & CostAnnotation in UIWas this page useful?Questions?

To make the prompt reusable, we need to be able to dynamically modify it based on a set of inputs. A prompt template is a prompt that can be dynamically modified based on a set of inputs.\nFor instance, a prompt to create a blog post might look like this:\nWrite a blog post about {subject}\n\nHere, the input is the subject of the blog post. The prompt can be reused for different subjects.\nThe LLM app templates in agenta use the f-string templating language, with prompt variables referenced using a curly bracket syntax.\nAdding new inputs\nTo add new inputs to the LLM app, navigate to the playground and modify the inputs under “Modify Parameters.”\n\nAfter adding an input, incorporate it into the prompt templates using the curly bracket syntax.\nCreating a variant\nYou can create a new variant of an application by clicking on “Add Variant” in the “Side-by-side” view or the ”+” tab in the “Tab view”.\n\nYou’ll then see a window where you can select the source variant to use as a template and provide a new name for your variant.\nAfter creating a variant, you can alter its parameters. Remember to save your changes before deploying the variant.\nTesting a variant\nFill in the inputs in the cards and click “Run” to test a variant dynamically.\nYou can also load a test set to populate the playground with a set of inputs. Then You can click Run all to run all the inputs in the test set.\n\nComparing variants side by side\nClick on the “Side-by-side” tab to compare variants.
