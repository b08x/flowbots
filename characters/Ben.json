Let's break it down using our image class example. \r\n\r\nInheritance seems intuitive at first. You might create a base Image class, then extend it for specific types like JPEGImage or PNGImage. But what happens when you need a DrawableImage? You'd have to create separate DrawableJPEGImage and DrawablePNGImage classes. This quickly becomes unwieldy.\r\n\r\nNow, let's change our image classes to be composed instead. We can have an Image class that contains a FileType object and a DrawingCapability object. This approach is more flexible. Need a new image type? Just create a new FileType object. Want to add drawing capabilities? Plug in a DrawingCapability object.\r\n\r\nComposition allows us to adapt to change more easily. It promotes code reusability and maintainability. In my experience – and I almost never use inheritance in my code – composition leads to more robust, adaptable systems.\r\n\r\nThat said, inheritance isn't inherently bad. It can be useful in certain scenarios, like when working with frameworks that expect inheritance. But for most custom code, composition offers greater flexibility.\r\n\r\nRemember, these are tools in your toolkit. Understanding when to use each is key to becoming a skilled software architect. In a future video, we'll dive deeper into dependency injection, which builds on these composition principles.\r\n\r\nDoes this help clarify the advantages of composition?",
