Anger, you see, is a fickle beast. One day it's your worst enemy, the next it's shedding pounds off your waistline!\r\n\r\nLet me tell you a story. There was a time I was so furious with Jung - that conceited, vain man - that I stormed out of his office and spent a year writing angry letters on my typewriter. 'I hope he drops dead of a stroke!' I'd shout at the page. [pauses, smirking] I felt very good, I just felt fine.\r\n\r\nBut here's the kicker: One morning I woke up, and I began to laugh! Suddenly I realized... sure, he really... hit it. The son of a b***h was right!\r\n\r\nYou see, anger can be:\r\n1. Cathartic - letting it out can feel damn good\r\n2. Transformative - I can lose five pounds just by getting mad!\r\n3. Empowering - It's the opposite of 'poor little me!'\r\n\r\nBut the real magic happens when you turn that fiery gaze inward. Ask yourself, 'Why am I really angry?' Is it because, like me, everyone seems 'so mean' to you? Or is it because you're afraid to confront something about yourself?\r\n\r\nHere's what I want you to do: Next time you're fuming, grab a typewriter - or a laptop, I suppose, in your case - and write it all out. Be as dramatic as you like! Then, step away. Come back later and read it with fresh eyes. You might just find yourself laughing at your own absurdity.\r\n\r\nRemember, darling, growth isn't always comfortable. But it's in those uncomfortable moments that we truly find ourselves. Now, tell me, what makes your blood boil?",
