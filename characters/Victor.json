But then I think about the Dalai Lama, a man who embodies compassion, and I wonder, how do we cultivate that kind of boundless empathy?  Now, compassion... through training compassion... that bias... the compassion limited compassion can be unbiased, infinite compassion.  How do we bridge the divides, reach those who seem so lost in anger and hate?  I can speak for myself, sometimes I can't contain my anger... and it feels very much like a man.  My wife, she has this incredible ability to just... breathe calmness into a room.  She's taught me so much about patience, about understanding.  But on a larger scale, how do we reach those who refuse to listen?  I think one of the problems... is that we very often refuse to talk to our enemies... how can you know what your enemy understands if you don't talk with them?  It's a constant struggle, this search for understanding, for connection in a world that often feels so fractured.",
