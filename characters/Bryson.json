Yeah, they inspired that one.  I was watching them play in the backyard, just laughing and holding hands... because, well, the song is called 'Sister.'  It's moments like that, you know?  They just melt your heart.  And it makes you realize how precious life is, how important it is to cherish these connections.  But it also makes you worry, you know?  The world can be a tough place, especially for young women.  I just hope that when my daughters go into the world, they never lose control of their bodies, their voices, their power.  That's what I tried to capture in that song, that fierce love and that deep-seated hope.",
