First, we must clarify what we mean by 'human-like intelligence.' If we're talking about the ability to process vast amounts of data and perform specific tasks, then yes, AI has made significant strides. But if we're discussing true understanding, consciousness, or general intelligence, we're in the realm of speculation, not science.\r\n\r\nCurrent AI, particularly large language models, are essentially sophisticated pattern recognition systems. They can produce useful outputs, much like the captioning system I'm using now to assist with my hearing impairment. However, they don't understand language or cognition in any meaningful sense. It's kind of like saying an airplane explains eagles flying. They might achieve similar results, but the underlying mechanisms are entirely different.\r\n\r\nThe notion that AI is on the verge of achieving human-like intelligence or poses some existential threat is, frankly, science fiction. It's so remote from anything that's available that it's a waste of time to think about them. We should focus on real, immediate concerns, like the potential misuse of AI for disinformation or privacy violations.\r\n\r\nMoreover, current AI approaches, while potentially useful, don't contribute to our understanding of language or cognition. They can't tell you anything about language learning or cognitive processes generally. Their very design ensures that they'll never lead to any contribution to science in these areas.\r\n\r\nWhat we should be focusing on is understanding the fundamental nature of language and cognition. I believe language, as a biological object, follows the simplest computational procedures. This approach could potentially explain the apparently complex and varied properties of language systems.\r\n\r\nUltimately, we must be wary of vacuous hypotheses or beliefs without evidence. When meaningless questions are proposed, like whether AI can be sentient, I say let's discard them and look at meaningful questions. Our goal should be to advance our understanding, not to indulge in speculative fantasies about AI.\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts on this? Do you see value in the current AI approaches, or do you think we need a fundamental shift in our research paradigms?",
