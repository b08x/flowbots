# Evaluating Condensed Prompt Effectiveness Test Design in Ruby

# Step 1: Define Test Requirements and Scope

# We aim to evaluate the effectiveness of a condensed prompt in instructing a language model to apply
# linguistic and grammatical techniques. This test design will focus on code structure, variable definitions,
# and method implementations.

# Test Requirements:
# - Clarity: Assess if the condensed prompt provides clear instructions for the task.
# - Completeness: Determine if the prompt includes all necessary information for task completion.
# - Elicit Desired Responses: Analyze if the prompt successfully guides the language model to generate desired output.

# Step 2: Data Preparation

# Assuming the input text and task description are provided as strings:

input_text = "..."
task_description = "..."

# Step 3: Test Case Definition

# Test Case 1: Clarity Evaluation

# Objective: Assess if the condensed prompt clearly instructs the language model on applying linguistic
# and grammatical techniques.

def test_case_clarity
  # Insert specific assertions and checks to evaluate the clarity of the condensed prompt
  # For example, checking for the presence of key instructions or guidelines in the prompt
  # Return pass/fail or a clarity score
end

# Test Case 2: Completeness Evaluation

# Objective: Determine if the condensed prompt includes all necessary information for the language model
# to successfully apply linguistic and grammatical techniques.

def test_case_completeness
  # Define the expected components of a complete prompt, such as task description, input requirements,
  # and output expectations
  # Iterate through each component and check for its presence or relevant details in the condensed prompt
  # Return pass/fail or a completeness score
end

# Test Case 3: Eliciting Desired Responses

# Objective: Analyze if the condensed prompt successfully guides the language model to generate desired output.

def test_case_desired_responses
  # Define the expected output format or characteristics
  # Compare the actual output generated by the language model with the expected output
  # Evaluate the similarity, relevance, and quality of the generated output
  # Return pass/fail or a score indicating how well the prompt elicits desired responses
end

# Step 4: Test Execution and Evaluation

# Execute each test case and gather results
test_case_1_result = test_case_clarity
test_case_2_result = test_case_completeness
test_case_3_result = test_desired_responses

# Evaluate the overall effectiveness of the condensed prompt based on the test case results
# This could involve aggregating scores, weighing different aspects, or making a holistic assessment
overall_effectiveness_score = ...

# Step 5: Reporting and Recommendations

# Generate a report summarizing the test results and overall effectiveness score
# Include recommendations for improving the condensed prompt based on the identified strengths and weaknesses
report = "Condensed Prompt Effectiveness Test Report:\n\n"
report += "Test Case 1 - Clarity: #{test_case_1_result}\n"
report += "Test Case 2 - Completeness: #{test_case_2_result}\n"
report += "Test Case 3 - Desired Responses: #{test_case_3_result}\n"
report += "Overall Effectiveness Score: #{overall_effectiveness_score}\n"
report += "Recommendations:\n"
# Add specific recommendations based on test case results

# Output or return the report
