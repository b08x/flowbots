# Flowbots



> Develop a no-code evaluation development platform that enables subject-matter experts without coding or AI experience to create rigorous evaluations for large language models, specifically focusing on societal impacts such as harmful biases, discrimination, and over-reliance.

## üéØ Core Components

### 1. Nano Bots Integration

- Lightweight, specialized AI-powered bots
- Effortlessly shareable as single, lightweight files
- Configurable via human-readable YAML instructions

### 2. Jongleur Workflow Management

- Process scheduling and management
- Execution of tasks as separate OS processes
- Handling of task dependencies and parallel execution

### 3. Redis-based State Management

- Efficient storage and retrieval of intermediate results
- Enabling stateful interactions between workflow stages

### 4. NLP Processing Pipeline

- Tokenization using PragmaticTokenizer
- Part-of-speech tagging and morphology analysis with ruby-spacy
- Customizable analysis and evaluation stages

### 5. Evaluation and Feedback Loop

- Integration with automatic evaluation tools
- Support for incorporating human feedback
- Dynamic adjustment of agent behavior based on feedback

## üöÄ Example Workflow

Flowbots currently supports a multi-stage NLP processing and evaluation workflow:

1.  **Extract**: Tokenize input text and store in Redis
2.  **Transform**: Perform linguistic analysis (POS tagging, morphology)
3.  **Evaluate**: Assess NLP prompts using automatic evaluation tools
4.  **Feedback**: Incorporate human feedback for continuous improvement
5.  **Load**: Export results in JSONL format
