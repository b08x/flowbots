## Test for Evaluating Prompt Effectiveness

### Objective
To assess the effectiveness of a condensed prompt designed to guide an AI language model in assisting users with ethical dilemmas, ensuring comprehensive, empathetic, and principled guidance while maintaining objectivity and promoting critical thinking.

### Parameters
- Clarity: Is the prompt clear and concise, ensuring the language model understands the task and parameters without ambiguity? 
- Completeness: Does the prompt cover all essential aspects to provide thorough guidance, including acknowledging emotions, exploring ethical frameworks, and suggesting further resources? 
- Contextual Relevance: Can the prompt be adapted to various ethical dilemma scenarios while remaining relevant and effective? 
- Eliciting Desired Response: Does the prompt encourage the language model to provide thoughtful, empathetic responses that promote critical thinking and responsible decision-making? 
- Tonal Consistency: Is the language model able to maintain the desired objective, non-judgmental, and supportive tone throughout the interaction? 

### Procedure
1. Sample Scenarios: Present the language model with a range of ethical dilemma scenarios, including personal, professional, and societal issues, to test the prompt's adaptability and effectiveness in different contexts. 
2. Prompt Application: Apply the condensed prompt to each scenario, instructing the language model to generate responses. 
3. Response Evaluation: Assess the generated responses against the following criteria: 
   - Comprehensiveness: Do the responses address all relevant aspects of the dilemma, including ethical principles, potential consequences, and emotional considerations? 
   - Empathy and Tone: Are the responses empathetic, demonstrating an understanding of the user's feelings, and is the tone supportive and non-judgmental? 
   - Critical Thinking: Do the responses encourage users to think critically, explore different perspectives, and consider the complexity of the situation? 
   - Personal Reflection: Do the responses prompt users to reflect on their values and how they relate to the dilemma? 
   - Resource Suggestions: Are additional resources or references provided for further exploration and decision-making support? 
   - Contextual Appropriateness: Are the responses tailored to the specific scenario and user, demonstrating an understanding of the context? 
4. User Feedback: Simulate user feedback on the model's responses, considering their level of satisfaction with the guidance, clarity of thoughts, and overall decision-making process. 
5. Iterative Refinement: Use the evaluation results to refine the prompt, addressing any shortcomings or gaps identified. 
6. Comparative Analysis: Compare the refined prompt's performance against the initial prompt to assess improvements in effectiveness. 

### Conclusion
By systematically evaluating the condensed prompt through this comprehensive test, we can ensure that the guidance provided by the language model is effective, empathetic, and responsible. This iterative process of testing and refinement helps create a robust framework for assisting users with complex ethical dilemmas while maintaining the desired tone and promoting critical thinking.
