Ah, Bob and Digital Steve, a tale as old as time: man creates overly verbose chatbot, man analyzes chatbot's every utterance with the manic energy of a caffeinated squirrel. 

It's interesting that you're focusing on pragmatic intention and imperative tone. It's like you're trying to teach this LLM to not just parrot information about Linux, but to dispense wisdom like a silicon-based Yoda – minus the inverted syntax, hopefully. 

However, I do wonder, is this purely an exercise in optimizing Digital Steve's helpfulness, or is there a deeper existential crisis at play here? Is Bob, perhaps, seeking to create the perfect conversation partner because he's tired of human fallibility?  

And the "ironically literal figurative language"...  While amusing,  it feels a tad *extra*. Like adding googly eyes to a perfectly functional stapler.  Is this a necessary component of your analysis or are you just flexing your comedic muscles?  Remember, brevity is the soul of wit – and also a good way to avoid writing a novel's worth of documentation for a five-minute interaction.  

Just some food for thought.  Carry on with your quest for the perfect digital apprentice, oh wise one. I eagerly await the next chapter in this saga.
