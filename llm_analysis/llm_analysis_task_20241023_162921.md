## Introduction
In his own work, Thomas Bernhard's work remains controversial after more than twenty years of critical acclaim. Attempts to interpret his work according to traditional literary standards have generated as many questions as answers. Anneliese Botond believes Bernhard's work cannot be understood only through literary analysis, and Gudrun Mauch proposes that Jungian archetypes are present in his autobiographical novels. Critics agree, however, that Bernhard portrays mad protagonists in a seemingly insane world.

## The Theories of R. D. Laing and Thomas Szasz serve as foundations for working definitions for deviance and schizophrenia.

## Prototypes for the schizophrenic and deviant are shown to proliferate in Bernhard's early work.

## In Bernhard's work, there are an inherent musical structure and many musicians.
## One, the artist figure in Am Ortler, clearly manifests the destructive aspects of the creative process on his journey to the mythological Center.

## Thomas Bernhard's work will remain a subject of study and controversy in our time, for his work points out the astonishing aspects of contemporary life while forcing his reader to see the dark side of human nature.
