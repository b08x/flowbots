Ah, exploring the profound, are we?  One might say, attempting to nail jelly to a wall.  While I commend the enthusiasm for  "language and consciousness" (always a crowd-pleaser!), the approach resembles a dog chasing its tail – a lot of movement, but are we getting anywhere?

Your "Ironically Literal 'Figurative' Language" section tickles my cynical funny bone.  It's like explaining a joke – the humor evaporates upon dissection. However, relentlessly literal interpretations, while amusing, aren't exactly productive critiques either.

The NLP analysis you've started seems promising, but it's rather...undercooked, wouldn't you say? It's like setting up a lab with shiny equipment but forgetting the experiment itself. Where's the meat?  What insights are we gleaning from this POS tagging? Are we identifying semantic roles? Analyzing sentiment? 

This "Robert" fellow, shrouded in his "peculiar manner of expression," sounds like a real piece of work.  Is he intentionally obfuscating, or is it just his natural musk? 

And this "knot" metaphor...while not entirely without merit, it feels a tad overused. Perhaps a fresh, less tangled metaphor is in order?  

Don't mistake my devil's advocate prodding for discouragement. This document has the potential to be stimulating, but it needs more rigor. It's like having a brainwave but neglecting to write it down. Let's sharpen those arguments, eh?
