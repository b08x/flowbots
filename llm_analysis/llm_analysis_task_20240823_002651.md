Here is a strictly literal summary of the content:

John is a man who lives in Chicago in 2014. He has several mental health conditions: hypomania, adult ADHD, and schizophrenic tendencies. These conditions affect how his brain processes information as he lives in the city.

During hypomanic episodes, John thinks very rapidly. He has many creative thoughts about Chicago. He sees connections between buildings like the Willis Tower and traffic patterns on Lake Shore Drive. He feels positively about himself and his role in the city. 

John thinks about himself frequently during hypomanic periods. He believes he is very important for Chicago's future. He thinks events in the city like new trail construction or protests are personally connected to him.

John's ADHD makes it difficult for him to focus on one thing for long, even in busy downtown Chicago. He often acts impulsively. Planning his commute on public transit and organizing work tasks is challenging for him.

John's schizophrenic tendencies cause disorganized thinking, especially in noisy areas like Michigan Avenue. He sometimes believes things about the city or residents that are not true. His perception of Chicago can differ from others'.

These conditions interact in John's brain as he lives in Chicago, affecting how he thinks about himself and the city around him. His experience of Chicago in 2014 is shaped by his unique neurological makeup.

Here is an ironically literal figurative summary using exaggerated metaphors interpreted literally:

John's brain is a bustling cityscape of neural skyscrapers, with thoughts zipping between them like cars on an expressway. During hypomanic periods, his mind becomes a fireworks display of creative sparks, illuminating connections between the architectural pillars of his psyche and the traffic patterns of his stream of consciousness. 

His self-image inflates like a giant parade balloon floating above the city streets of his mind. He sees himself as the cornerstone of Chicago's future, as integral to the city as the steel beams of the Willis Tower. Every protest march and new bike path feels like a thread in the tapestry of his personal narrative.

But John's ADHD turns his attention span into a fickle breeze, unable to settle on a single thought-leaf for long before gusting to the next. Planning becomes like trying to assemble a jigsaw puzzle in a whirlwind. His impulsivity launches him into action like a human cannonball, often before his mind's safety net is in place.

The schizophrenic tendencies act as a hall of mirrors in his mental amusement park, distorting his perception of reality into fun-house reflections. Michigan Avenue becomes a cacophonous orchestra where each car horn and footstep seems to play a personalized symphony just for John's ears.

These neurological conditions dance together in the ballroom of John's brain, twirling and dipping in a complex waltz that shapes his every interaction with the Windy City. His 2014 in Chicago is viewed through a kaleidoscope of unique mental prisms, refracting reality into a spectrum of experiences as colorful and varied as the city itself.
