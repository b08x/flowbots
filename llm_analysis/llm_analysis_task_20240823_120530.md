Segment: "But, it's not just about computers understanding language; it's also about, uh, how we use language to interact with computers."
Parts of Speech: 
- Conjunction: But
- Verb: is
- Determiner: it
- Verb: use
- Pronoun: we
- Noun: language
- Preposition: to

From this analysis, we can observe the use of discourse markers such as "um," "uh," and "pauses," which are common in spoken language and can indicate hesitation or thought processing. These features are relevant in NLP for developing models that can handle such nuances in human speech. Additionally, the text discusses the interaction between humans and computers, which is a core aspect of NLP applications like virtual assistants and chatbots. The mention of "Siri," "Alexa," and "phones" refers to real-world applications of NLP, highlighting its practical importance.

The text also touches on the semiotic aspect of language, where "language" is not just a string of words but carries meaning and intent, which NLP systems aim to interpret. The phrase "it's like" is used to draw analogies, a common technique in explaining complex concepts, showing how NLP tries to mimic human-like understanding.

In terms of NLP terminology, the text uses terms like "field of study," "interaction," "understand," "generate," and "language," which are central to the field. The discussion about the limitations and expectations of NLP reflects the ongoing challenges in creating systems that can accurately interpret and respond to human language, a key area of research in NLP.

Overall, the text provides a casual yet informative overview of NLP, touching on its applications, challenges, and the interdisciplinary nature of the field, which includes linguistics, computer science, and cognitive psychology. The semiotic features, such as the use of language for communication and the importance of context, are crucial for understanding the complexities of NLP. The dry wit and casual tone, as requested, help to maintain engagement while conveying technical concepts.
